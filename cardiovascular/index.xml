Can be stable or unstable
stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.</description></item><item><title>Aortic Stenosis</title><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Aortic-Stenosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Aortic-Stenosis/</guid><description>Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis - stiffening, narrowing
Pressure overload - high resistance low reps -&amp;gt; hypertrophy
Causes/Factors Congenital: bicuspid aortic value Calcification of the valve causing narrowing Age 65+ Symptoms [[Angina]] Breathlessness on exercise Pre-syncope/syncope Signs Hard and loud ejection systolic murmur Between S1 and S2 Reduced pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic) Forceful apex beat Diagnostic Tests Echocardiogram - left hypertrophy with poor valve movement possible regurgitation ECG - poor R wave progression and stuff which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand yet Management If pressure difference between ventricle and aorta remains below 60 mmHg the patient is kept under observation</description></item><item><title>Atrial Fibrillation</title><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Atrial-Fibrillation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Atrial-Fibrillation/</guid><description>Atrial Fibrillation A rapid irregular atrial rhythm at 300-600 bpm.

Tetralogy features:
Ventricular septal defect (VSD) [[Pulmonary stenosis]] Right ventricular hypertrophy Overriding aorta (aorta more central in heart and accepts right sided blood) Causes/Factors Congenital (both environmental and genetic factors) Severity of illness depends greatly on degree of pulmonary stenosis Symptoms With closure of ductus arteriosus infants become more cyanotic due to decreasing flow of blood to the lungs and increasing right to left flow across VSD Difficulty in feeding/gaining weight Delayed growth Dyspnoea of exertion Signs Children may squat during hypercyanotic spell as it increases systemic vascular resistance and temporary reversal of shunt Pulmonary murmur Diagnostic Tests Echo demonstrates abnormal anatomy ECG can also show hypertrophy Cardiac CT shows clearer anatomy valuable for surgery Management Oxygen Surgery to repair VSD and replace pulmonary valve Complications/red Flags pulmonary regurgitation RV outflow tract obstruction</description></item><item><title>Heart Block</title><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Heart-Block/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Heart-Block/</guid><description>Heart Block Disrupted passage of electrical impulse through the AVN
