Acute Coronary Syndrome Acute coronary syndrome is a term used to describe a range of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Angina/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Angina/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular #Incomplete
Angina Pain due to partial blockage of a coronary vessel. Can be stable or unstable
stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Aortic-Stenosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Aortic-Stenosis/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular
Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis - stiffening, narrowing
Pressure overload - high resistance low reps -&amp;gt; hypertrophy
Causes/Factors Congenital: bicuspid aortic value Calcification of the valve causing narrowing Age 65+ Symptoms [[Angina]] Breathlessness on exercise Pre-syncope/syncope Signs Hard and loud ejection systolic murmur Between S1 and S2 Reduced pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic) Forceful apex beat Diagnostic tests Echocardiogram - left hypertrophy with poor valve movement possible regurgitation ECG - poor R wave progression and stuff which I don&amp;rsquo;t understand yet Management If pressure difference between ventricle and aorta remains below 60 mmHg the patient is kept under observation</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Atrial-Fibrillation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Atrial-Fibrillation/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular
Atrial Fibrillation A rapid irregular atrial rhythm at 300-600 bpm. The AV node blocks most of these impulses and only responds intermittently (hence irregular QRS).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Coronary-Artery-Disease/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Coronary-Artery-Disease/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular
Coronary Artery Disease Coronary artery disease is a narrowing or blockage of your coronary arteries usually caused by the buildup of fatty material called plaque under the endothelium.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Deep-Vein-Thrombosis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Deep-Vein-Thrombosis/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular #Haematology

peripheral vascular disease aka Peripheral arterial disease
Narrowing, blockage, or spasms in a blood vessel can cause PVD. PVD may affect any blood vessel outside of the heart including the arteries, veins, or lymphatic vessels.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Splinter-haemorrhages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Splinter-haemorrhages/</guid><description>Tags: #Symptom</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Tricuspid-regurgitation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Tricuspid-regurgitation/</guid><description>#Cardiovascular #Incomplete</description></item><item><title/><link>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Ventricular-Fibrillation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://notes.nosos.co.uk/Cardiovascular/Ventricular-Fibrillation/</guid><description>Tags: #Cardiovascular
