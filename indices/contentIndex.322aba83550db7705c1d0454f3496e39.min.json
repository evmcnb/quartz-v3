In the context of an abdominal examination, this may suggest underlying cholestasis.\n-   **Needle track marks:** important to note as intravenous drug use can be associated with an increased risk of viral hepatitis.\n\n#### Axillae\nWhilst supporting the patient’s arm, **inspect** each **axilla** for the following:\n\n-   **Acanthosis nigricans:** darkening (hyperpigmentation) and thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the axillary skin which can be benign (most commonly in dark-skinned individuals) or associated with insulin resistance (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) or gastrointestinal malignancy (most commonly stomach cancer).\n-   **Hair loss:** loss of axillary hair associated with iron-deficiency anaemia and malnutrition.\n\n## Face\n\n#### Eyes\n-   **Conjunctival pallor:** underlying anaemia\n-   **Jaundice:** most evident in the superior portion of the sclera (ask the patient to look downwards as you lift their upper eyelid).\n-   **Corneal arcus:** a hazy white, grey or blue opaque ring located in the peripheral cornea. In older patients, the condition is considered benign, however, if patient \u003c50 - underlying hypercholesterolaemia.\n-   **Xanthelasma:** yellow, raised cholesterol-rich deposits around the eyes associated with hypercholesterolaemia.\n-   **Kayser-Fleischer rings:** dark rings that encircle the iris associated with [[Wilson’s disease]]. The disease involves abnormal copper processing by the liver, resulting in accumulation and deposition in various tissues (causing [[Liver Cirrhosis]]).\n\n#### Lymph Nodes\nThe left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow's node) receives lymphatic drainage from the abdominal cavity so can be one of the first signs of intraabdominal malignancy\n- Palpate lymph nodes\n![|325](z_attachments/325.png)\n\n\n## Chest\n\n#### Inspect\n\n-   **Spider naevi:** skin lesions caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen. Can be a normal finding in pregnancy or in women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill. If more than 5 are present it is more likely to be associated with pathology such as [[Liver Cirrhosis]].\n-   **Gynaecomastia:** enlargement of male breast tissue caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Other causes include medications such as digoxin and spironolactone.\n-   **Hair loss:** also caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen. General malnourishment can also result in hair loss.\n\n## Abdomen\nPosition the patient lying flat on the bed.\n\n#### Inspect\n- Scars - past surgery\n- Abdominal distension - **six f's**: fat, fluid, flatus, faeces, foetus or funking large tumour\n- Caput medusae - engorged paraumbilical veins associated with portal hypertension\n- Striae -stretch marks - [[Liver Cirrhosis|ascites]], intrabdominal malignancy, [[Cushing's Syndrome]], obesity [[Pregnancy]]\n- Hernias - ask patient to cough\n\n\n## Abdominal Palpation\nAsk the patient if they are aware of any areas of abdominal pain (if present examine last). Keep good eye contact to look for discomfort\n\n### Light Palpation of the Abdomen\n-   **Tenderness:** note the abdominal region(s) involved and the severity of the pain.\n-   **Rebound tenderness:** said to be present when the abdominal wall, having been compressed slowly, is released rapidly and results in sudden sharp abdominal pain. Weakly associated with peritonitis\n-   **Voluntary guarding:** contraction of the abdominal muscles in response to pain\n-   **Involuntary guarding/rigidity:** involuntary tension in the abdominal muscles that occurs on palpation associated with peritonitis (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis)_._\n-   **Masses:** large or superficial masses (e.g. hernias) may be noted on light palpation.\n\n\n### Deep Palpation\nWarn the patient this may feel uncomfortable - carefully monitor face\nIf any **masses** are identified during deep palpation, assess the following characteristics:\n\n-   **Location:** note which of the nine abdominal regions the mass located within.\n-   **Size and shape:** assess the approximate size and shape of the mass.\n-   **Consistency:** assess the consistency of the mass (e.g. smooth, soft, hard, irregular).\n-   **Mobility:** assess if the mass appears to be attached to superficial or underlying structures.\n-   **Pulsatility:** note if the mass feels pulsatile, suggestive of vascular aetiology (e.g. abdominal aortic aneurysm).\n\n\n##### Palpate Liver\n1. Begin in right iliac fossa starting using flat edge of right hand\n2. Ask patient to take deep breath and begin to palpate and see if can feel edge of liver\n3. Repeat process moving 1-2cm superiorly each time\n4.  If you are able to identify the **liver edge**, assess the following characteristics:\n\t-   **Degree of extension below the costal margin:** if greater than 2 cm this suggests hepatomegaly.\n\t-   **Consistency of the liver edge:** a nodular consistency is suggestive of cirrhosis.\n\t-   **Tenderness**: hepatic tenderness may suggest hepatitis or cholecystitis (as you may be palpating the gallbladder)\n\t-   **Pulsatility:** pulsatile hepatomegaly is associated with tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n##### Palpate Gallbladder\nIn healthy individuals the gallbladder isn't usually palpable. If palpable suggests enlargement secondary to biliary flow obstruction and/or infection ([[Cholecystitis]])\n**Murphy's sign**\n1. Position fingers at the right costal margin in mid-clavicular line\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath\n3. If patient suddenly stops mid-breath due to pain, suggests [[Cholecystitis]] - Murphy's sign positive\n\n##### Palpate the Spleen\n- Same process and beginning as liver but move towards left costal margin instead of right\nIn healthy individuals you should not be able to palpate the spleen.\n\n##### Ballot the Kidneys\n1. Place hands in this position and push fingers together\n![|325](z_attachments/325-1.png)\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath and feel for kidney moving down\n3. If kidney ballotable describe size and consistency\n4. Repeat on other side\nIn healthy individuals the kidneys are not usually ballotable but in low BMI patients might be possible\n-   Bilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidneys can occur in [[Polycystic Kidney Disease]] or [[amyloidosis]].\n-   A unilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidney can be caused by a renal tumour.\n\n##### Palpate the Aorta\n**1.** Using both hands perform deep palpation just superior to the umbilicus in the midline.\n**2.** Note the movement of your fingers should be superiorly not laterally which might suggest an expansile mass (AAA)\n\n##### Palpate the Bladder\nWarm might be uncomfortable and made cause the urge to go to the toilet.\nA distended bladder can be palpated in the **suprapubic area** arising from behind the **pubic symphysis** (e.g. urinary obstruction/retention). In most healthy patients who are passing urine regularly, the bladder will **not** be palpable.\n- Use side of left hand to palpate from umbilical region downwards\n\n\n## Abdominal Percussion\n\n##### Percuss the Liver\n1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **right costal margin** until the percussion note changes to dull\n2. Continue to percuss upward until the note changes back to resonant indicating the upper border\n3. Determine approximate size of liver\n\n##### Percuss the Spleen\n1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **left costal margin**\n2. The spleen should not be identifiable using percussion in healthy patients\n\n##### Percuss the Bladder\n1. Percuss downwards in the midline from the umbilical region towards the pubic symphysis\n2. A distended bladder will be dull to percussion\n\n##### Assess Shifting Dullness\n1. Percuss from the umbilical region to patients left flank - if dullness noted - may suggest ascitic fluid\n2. Whilst keeping fingers over the area at which the note became dull, ask patient to roll onto their side\n3. Keep patient on their side for 30 seconds and then repeat percussion over the same area\n4. If ascites is present the area should now be resonant \n\n\n## Abdominal Auscultation\n\n#### Assess Bowl Sounds\n**Auscultate** over **at least two** **positions** on the abdomen to **assess bowel sounds**:\n\n-   **Normal bowel sounds:** typically described as gurgling (listen to an example in our video demonstration)\n-   **Tinkling bowel sounds:** typically associated with bowel obstruction.\n-   **Absent bowel sounds:** suggests ileus which is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine due to a malfunction of peristalsis.\n\n#### Listen for Bruits\n**Auscultate** over the **aorta** and **renal arteries** to identify **vascular** **bruits** suggestive of turbulent blood flow:\n\n-   **Aortic bruits:** auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus, a bruit here may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n-   **Renal bruits:** auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus and slightly lateral to the midline on each side. A bruit in this location may be associated with renal artery stenosis.\n\n## Legs\nAssess the patient’s **lower legs** for evidence of **pitting oedema** which may suggest **hypoalbuminemia** (e.g. [[Liver Cirrhosis]], protein-losing enteropathy).\n\n\n## To Complete the Exam\n- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.\n- **Thank the patient** for their time.\n- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.\n- **Summarise** your findings.\n\n## Further Assessments and Investigations\n-   Check hernial orifices (e.g. if there are signs of bowel obstruction). \n-   If there is suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding perform a PR exam.\n-  To rule out testicular torsion or indirect inguinal hernia a external genitalia exam may be needed\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.252744407Z","tags":["Examination","OSCE","Gastroenterology"]},"/Acute-Coronary-Syndrome":{"title":"Acute Coronary Syndrome","content":"\nAcute coronary syndrome is **a term used to describe a range of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart**.\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.252744407Z","tags":["Cardiovascular"]},"/Acute-Kidney-Injury":{"title":"Acute Kidney Injury","content":"\nPreviously known as acute renal failure.\nUsually doesn't occur in isolation\n\n**Stages**\n\n| Stage | Creatinine                                                                | Urine Output              |\n| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 1     | SCr increase \u003e26 $\\mu$mol/L within 48hr or SCr increase 1.5-1.9x baseline | \u003c0.5mL/kg/hr for 6 hours  |\n| 2     | SCr 2-2.9x increase from baseline                                         | \u003c0.5mL/kg/hr for 12 hours |\n| 3     | SCr 3x increase etc, SCr increase $\\geq$ 354, initiated on RRT            | \u003c0.3mL/kg/hr for 24 hrs   |\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nLots of risk factors like age 75+, [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Heart Failure]], etc\n\n**Pre-renal** - something causes $\\downarrow$ BP\n\n- vomiting\n- Diarrhoea\n- Diuretics\n- Haemorrhage\n- Burns\n- Renal Artery Stenosis\n\n**Intrinsic** - something within the kidney\n\n- NSAIDS\n- Nephrotoxins\n- [[Glomerulonephritis]]\n- Vascular\n\n**Post-renal**\n\n- Kidney stones\n- Tumours\n- Retroperitoneal fibrosis\n\n## Clinical Presentation\n\n- AKI is usually a silent disease\n- Possibly kidney stones\n- Always suspect in acute patients with risk factors\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\n- FBC, U\u0026E and bicarbonate, C reactive protein (CRP), LFTs\n- Calcium \u0026 phosphate\n- Creatine kinase\n- Urinalysis\n- Ultrasound if suspected obstruction\n- Biopsy\n\n## Management\n\n- Manage underlying cause of AKI\n- Supportive - renal (kidney) replacement therapy\n  - hyperkalaemia - non-responsive to medicine\n  - pH \u003c7.1\n  - high urea\n\n## Complications/red Flags\n\n**Refractory Hyperkalaemia**\n\n- Leads to tented T-wave\n  ![|325](z_attachments/325-2.png)\n- Give calcium gluconate -\u003e protects heart and buys time, glucose/dextrose + insulin and possible salbutamol nebuliser\n\n**Acidosis**\n\n**Uraemic symptoms**\n\n- nausea\n- pruritis\n- malaise\n\n**Therapy-resistant fluid overload**\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.252744407Z","tags":["Nephrology"]},"/Alcohol-related-Liver-Disease":{"title":"Alcohol-related Liver Disease","content":"\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake.

If out of sync +ve test. Causes include:\n\n- Subclavian artery stenosis (e.g. compression by a cervical rib)\n- Aortic dissection\n- Aortic coarctation\n\n##### Collapsing Pulse\n\nA collapsing pulse is a forceful pulse that **rapidly increases** and subsequently **collapses**.\n**_Ask patient if in any pain in shoulder as going to have to move it rapidly_**\nCauses of a collapsing pulse:\n\n- Normal physiological states (e.g. fever, pregnancy)\n- Cardiac lesions (e.g. aortic regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus)\n- High output states (e.g. anaemia, arteriovenous fistula, thyrotoxicosis)\n\n##### Blood Pressure\n\nIn a cardiovascular examination OSCE station, you are **unlikely** to have to carry out a thorough blood pressure assessment due to time restraints, however, you should demonstrate that you have an awareness of what this would involve.\n\n## Neck\n\n#### Carotid Pulse\n\n##### Auscultate\n\nPrior to palpating the carotid artery need to rule out the presence of a **bruit**.\n\n1. Place bell of stethoscope over carotid pulse\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath in and hold\n3. Sound of a carotid bruit\n   ![[z_attachments/Carotid Bruit Sound.mp3|Carotid Bruit Sound]]\n4. The presence of a ‘carotid bruit’ may, in fact, be a **radiating cardiac murmur**\n\n##### Palpate\n\nIf no bruits were identified, proceed to **carotid pulse palpation**:\n1. Ensure the patient is positioned safely on the bed, as there is a risk of inducing reflex bradycardia when palpating the carotid artery (potentially causing a syncopal episode).\n2. Place fingers on carotid\n3. Assess the **character** (e.g. slow-rising, thready) and **volume** of the pulse.\n\n#### Jugular Vein\n\n##### Jugular Venous Pressure\n\nIndirect measure of central venous pressure (IJV connects to right atrium without any valves). Causes include [[Heart Failure]], [[Tricuspid regurgitation]] and constrictive [[Pericarditis]]\n\n1. Position the patient in a semi-recumbent position (at 45°).\n2. Ask the patient to turn their head slightly to the left\n3. Inspect for evidence of IJV running between the medial end of the clavicle and the ear lobe, under the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid\n4. Measure the JVP by assessing the vertical distance between the **sternal angle** and the **top of the pulsation point of the IJV** (in healthy individuals, this should be **no greater than 3 cm**).\n\n##### Hepatojugular Reflux Test (not Performed in an OSCE)\n\nThe hepatojugular reflux test involves the application of pressure to the liver whilst observing for a sustained rise in JVP.\n\n- In healthy individuals, this rise should last **no longer than 1-2 cardiac cycles** (it should then fall).\n- If the rise in JVP is **sustained** and **equal to or greater than 4cm** this is deemed a **positive result**.\n\nA **positive hepatojugular reflux result** suggests the **right ventricle is unable to accommodate an increased venous return**, but it is **not diagnostic** of any specific condition. Constrictive [[pericarditis]], right and left ventricular failure and restrictive [[cardiomyopathy]] can cause a positive result\n\n## Face\n\n#### Eyes\n\n- **Conjunctival pallor:** suggestive of underlying anaemia. Ask the patient to gently pull down their lower eyelid to allow you to inspect the conjunctiva.\n- **Corneal arcus:** a hazy white, grey or blue opaque ring located in the peripheral cornea. In older patients, the condition is considered benign, however, if patient \u003c50 - underlying hypercholesterolaemia.\n- **Xanthelasma:** yellow, raised cholesterol-rich deposits around the eyes - hypercholesterolaemia.\n- **Kayser-Fleischer rings:** dark rings that encircle the iris associated with [[Wilson’s disease]]. The disease involves abnormal copper processing by the liver, resulting in accumulation and deposition in various tissues (including the heart where it can cause [[cardiomyopathy]]).\n\n#### Mouth\n\n- **Central cyanosis:** bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia (e.g. a right to left cardiac shunt)\n- **Angular stomatitis:** a common inflammatory condition affecting the corners of the mouth. It has a wide range of causes including iron deficiency.\n- **High arched palate:** a feature of [[Marfan's syndrome]] which is associated with mitral/aortic valve prolapse and aortic dissection.\n- **Dental hygiene:** poor dental hygiene is a risk factor for infective [[Endocarditis]]\n\n## Chest\n\n#### Inspect\n\n- **Scars suggestive of previous thoracic surgery**\n- **Pectus excavatum:** a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest.\n- **Pectus carinatum:** protrusion of the sternum and ribs.\n- **Visible pulsations:** a forceful apex beat may be visible secondary to underlying ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n### Palpation\n\n##### Apex Beat\n\n- Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line\n- Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum\n\n##### Heaves\n\nA **parasternal heave** is a precordial impulse that can be palpated.\n\n- Place the **heel of your hand** parallel to the **left sternal edge** (fingers vertical) to palpate for heaves.\n- If heaves are present you should feel the heel of your hand being **lifted** with each systole.\n- Parasternal heaves are typically associated with **right ventricular hypertrophy**.\n\n##### Thrill\n\nA **thrill** is a **palpable vibration** caused by **turbulent blood flow** through a heart valve (a thrill is a palpable murmur).\nYou should assess for a thrill across **each of the heart valves** in turn\n\n![|475](z_attachments/475.png)\n\n### Auscultation\n\n1. Palpate the carotid pulse to determine the first heart sound.\n2. Auscultate ‘upwards’ through the valve areas using the **diaphragm** of the stethoscope whilst continuing to palpate the carotid pulse:\n\n- **Aortic valve:** 2nd intercostal space at the right sternal edge.\n- **Pulmonary valve:** 2nd intercostal space at the left sternal edge.\n- **Tricuspid valve:** 4th or 5th intercostal space at the lower left sternal edge.\n- **Mitral valve:** 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line.\n\n3. Possibly repeat with bell?\n\n##### Accentuation Manoeuvres\n\n- **Aortic stenosis** - auscultate the **carotid** **arteries** using the diaphragm of the stethoscope whilst the patient holds their breath to listen for radiation of an **ejection systolic murmur**\n  ![[z_attachments/Aortic Stenosis normal speed.mp3|Aortic Stenosis normal speed]]\n- **Aortic regurgitation** - sit the patient forwards and auscultate over the **aortic** **area** with the diaphragm of the stethoscope during **expiration** to listen for an **early diastolic murmur**\n  ![[z_attachments/Aortic Regurgitation normal speed.mp3|Aortic Regurgitation normal speed]]\n- **Mitral regurgitation** - roll the patient onto their **left side** and listen over the mitral area with the **diaphragm** of the stethoscope **during expiration** for a pansystolic murmur.

This disruption can be caused by various underlying medical conditions affecting the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nHorner Syndrome results from interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the brain and the eye. This interruption can occur due to several causes:\n\n1. **Central Causes:** Lesions or damage to the central nervous system, often within the brainstem or spinal cord.\n2. **Preganglionic Causes:** Interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the spinal cord and the superior cervical ganglion.\n3. **Postganglionic Causes:** Disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the superior cervical ganglion and the eye.\n4. **Congenital Causes:** Some individuals are born with Horner Syndrome due to developmental issues in the sympathetic nerve pathway.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nHorner Syndrome primarily affects one side of the face and eye, resulting in the following set of characteristic symptoms:\n\n- **Ptosis:** Drooping of the upper eyelid on the affected side.\n- **Miosis:** Constricted pupil in the affected eye.\n- **Anhidrosis:** Decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Ptosis:** The drooping of the upper eyelid may be subtle or pronounced.\n- **Miosis:** The affected pupil is noticeably smaller than the unaffected pupil.\n- **Anhidrosis:** The skin on the affected side of the face may appear dry due to reduced sweating.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nTo diagnose Horner Syndrome and identify the underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:\n\n- **Imaging:** MRI or CT scans to identify lesions or abnormalities in the central or sympathetic nervous system.\n- **Underlying Cause Investigation:** Determining the root cause of Horner Syndrome through medical history, physical examination, and additional tests.\n\n## Management\n\nThe management of Horner Syndrome involves addressing the underlying cause, which may vary depending on the specific case. If Horner Syndrome is caused by an identifiable condition, treatment will be aimed at managing or treating that condition. For cases with no apparent underlying cause, close monitoring may be recommended to detect any potential changes or developments.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nHorner Syndrome itself is a set of symptoms indicating disruption of the sympathetic nervous system. The most important aspect is identifying and addressing the underlying cause, as this could be indicative of a more serious medical condition such as:\n\n- **Brainstem Lesions:** Horner Syndrome can be a sign of a lesion or injury in the brainstem.\n- **Carcinomas:** Tumours, particularly in the chest or neck, can disrupt sympathetic pathways.\n- **Aneurysms:** An aneurysm affecting blood vessels can lead to Horner Syndrome.\n- **Pancoast Tumours:** Tumours located at the top of the lungs can cause Horner Syndrome.","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.252744407Z","tags":["Neurology","AIassisted"]},"/Hyperthyroidism":{"title":"Hyperthyroidism","content":"\n\n# Brief Overview\n\nHyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), play a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism. When the thyroid gland becomes overactive and releases an excessive amount of these hormones into the bloodstream, it leads to a state of hyperthyroidism. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave's disease]].\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\n1. **[[Grave's disease]]:** An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroid hormones. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism\n2. **Toxic Multinodular Goiter:** The thyroid gland develops multiple nodules that produce thyroid hormones independently, leading to an overproduction of hormones.\n3. **Toxic Adenoma:** A single nodule in the thyroid gland becomes overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones.\n4. **Subacute Thyroiditis:** Inflammation of the thyroid gland causes the release of stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream.\n5. **Excessive Iodine Intake:** Consuming a high amount of iodine, either through diet or medication, can lead to hyperthyroidism.\n6. **Medications:** Certain medications containing iodine or thyroid hormones can induce hyperthyroidism as a side effect.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- **Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite.\n- **Nervousness and Irritability:** Feeling anxious, jittery, or easily agitated.\n- **Heat Intolerance:** Feeling excessively hot in normal temperatures.\n- **Increased Sweating:** Perspiring more than usual, especially in the hands and feet.\n- **Tremors:** Fine trembling of the hands and fingers.\n- **Palpitations:** Rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak even without physical exertion.\n- **Muscle Weakness:** Experiencing muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs.\n- **Frequent Bowel Movements:** Having more frequent and sometimes loose bowel movements.\n- **Changes in Menstrual Patterns:** Irregular menstrual periods in women.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter):** The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.\n  - Smooth = Grave's disease\n  - Nodular = toxic nodules\n  - Tender = thyroid inflammation\n- **Tachycardia:** Abnormally fast heart rate.\n- **Exophthalmos:** In Grave's disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\n- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\n- **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity.\n- **Thyroid Scintigraphy:** Imaging test using radioactive iodine to identify nodules or areas of increased thyroid activity.\n- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland.\n- **Antibody Tests:** To detect antibodies associated with Grave's disease.\n\n## Management\n\n1. **Antithyroid Medications:** Drugs like Methimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) can lower thyroid hormone production.\n2. **Beta-Blockers:** Used to manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat and tremors.\n3. **Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** Destroys part of the thyroid gland to reduce hormone production.\n4. **Surgery (Thyroidectomy):** Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland in certain cases.\n5. **Iodine Restriction:** Limiting iodine intake to reduce hormone production in the thyroid gland.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\n- **Thyroid Storm:** A life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms, which requires immediate medical attention.\n- **Osteoporosis:** Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.\n- **Heart Problems:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure.\n- **[[Pregnancy]] Complications:** Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.252744407Z","tags":["Endocrinology","AIassisted"]},"/Hypothyroidism":{"title":"Hypothyroidism","content":"- Underactive thyroid\n\n- Hy**po** so low mood, slow, lethargic gain weight etc\n\n- Most common in women and older people\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis, also known as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]].

This buildup of fluid can compress the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties and other symptoms.\n## Causes/Factors\n\nPleural effusion can result from various underlying causes, including:\n\n1. **Infections:** Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections affecting the lungs, such as [[pneumonia]] or [[tuberculosis]].\n2. **Congestive [[Heart Failure]]:** Weakened heart function can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs.\n3. **Cancer:** Lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers can cause pleural effusion.\n4. **[[pulmonary embolism]]:** Blood clots in the lungs can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup.\n5. **Liver or Kidney Disease:** Impaired liver or kidney function can disrupt fluid balance and cause effusion.\n6. **Inflammatory Conditions:** Conditions like [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus|lupus]] or [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]] can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup.\n7. **Trauma:** Chest injuries or surgeries can result in pleural effusion.\n8. **Certain Medications:** Some drugs can cause fluid retention.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of pleural effusion can vary depending on the amount of fluid present and the underlying cause. Common symptoms include:\n\n- **Shortness of Breath:** Feeling breathless, especially during physical activity.\n- **Chest Pain:** Sharp or dull pain in the chest, often worsened by deep breathing or coughing.\n- **Cough:** Dry or productive cough, which may produce blood-tinged sputum.\n- **Reduced Breath Sounds:** Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side during auscultation.\n- **Fever:** Especially if the effusion is caused by infection.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak due to reduced lung function.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Dullness to Percussion:** When tapping the chest, the sound may be dull over the area of the effusion.\n- **Decreased Breath Sounds:** Reduced or absent breath sounds when listening with a stethoscope.\n- **Tracheal Shift:** The trachea may shift away from the affected side in large effusions.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nTo diagnose pleural effusion and determine its underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:\n\n- **Chest X-ray:** Provides an initial visualization of the pleural space and any fluid accumulation.\n- **Ultrasound:** Helps visualize the amount and location of fluid in real-time.\n- **CT Scan:** Offers detailed cross-sectional images for a better assessment of the pleural space.\n- **Thoracentesis:** Removal of fluid from the pleural space for analysis.\n- **Pleural Fluid Analysis:** Examination of the fluid to determine its composition and underlying cause.\n\n## Management\n\nThe management of pleural effusion depends on its underlying cause. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, remove excess fluid, and address the root cause. Treatment options include:\n\n1. **Thoracentesis:** Draining the excess fluid from the pleural space to relieve symptoms and facilitate diagnosis.\n2. **Medications:** Depending on the cause, medications such as antibiotics, diuretics, or anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed.\n3. **Treat Underlying Cause:** Addressing the condition causing the effusion, such as treating infections or managing heart failure.\n4. **Surgical Interventions:** In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to remove fluid or prevent future accumulations.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nUntreated or unmanaged pleural effusion can lead to serious complications, such as:\n\n- **Lung Collapse:** Severe effusions can compress the lung, causing it to collapse (atelectasis).\n- **Empyema:** Accumulation of pus within the pleural space due to bacterial infection.\n- **Respiratory Failure:** Severe effusion can lead to difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.256744483Z","tags":["Respiratory","AIassisted"]},"/Polycystic-Kidney-Disease":{"title":"Polycystic Kidney Disease","content":"\nPolycystic kidney disease is an inherited condition that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys.\n\n#### Autosomal Dominant (ADPKD)\n\n- PKD1/2 mutation\n- Small change - present as adults\n- Rarely any symptoms with child with the condition.

[[Hepatic encephalopathy]] and uraemia are other causes\n\n- Ask patient to stick arms out and cock hands back for 30 seconds\n\n##### Temperature\n\nPlace dorsal aspect of your hand onto patients to assess temperature\n\n##### Radial Pulse - Rhythm and Rate\n\n- 30 seconds and x2\n\n##### Respiratory Rate\n\nWhilst still palpating the radial pulse assess the patient's respiratory rate. Note any asymmetries in expiratory and inspiratory phases\n\n## Neck\n\n#### Jugular Vein\n\n##### Jugular Venous Pressure\n\nIndirect measure of central venous pressure (IJV connects to right atrium without any valves). Raised JVP indicates **venous hypertension** $\\rightarrow$ pulmonary hypertension $\\rightarrow$ [[Heart Failure|right-sided heart failure]]\n\n1. Position the patient in a semi-recumbent position (at 45°).\n2. Ask the patient to turn their head slightly to the left\n3. Inspect for evidence of IJV running between the medial end of the clavicle and the ear lobe, under the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid\n4. Measure the JVP by assessing the vertical distance between the **sternal angle** and the **top of the pulsation point of the IJV** (in healthy individuals, this should be **no greater than 3 cm**).\n\n##### Hepatojugular Reflux Test (not Performed in an OSCE)\n\nThe hepatojugular reflux test involves the application of pressure to the liver whilst observing for a sustained rise in JVP.\n\n- In healthy individuals, this rise should last **no longer than 1-2 cardiac cycles** (it should then fall).\n- If the rise in JVP is **sustained** and **equal to or greater than 4cm** this is deemed a **positive result**.\n\nA **positive hepatojugular reflux result** suggests the **right ventricle is unable to accommodate an increased venous return**, but it is **not diagnostic** of any specific condition.\n\n##### Trachea Position\n\nAnything that can shift the mediastinum can cause tracheal deviation\n\n1. Ensure patient neck is comfortable - position chin slightly downwards\n2. Dip your index finger into the thorax beside the trachea\n3. Gently apply side pressure to locate trachea\n4. Compare this space to the other side of the trachea using the same process\n5. A difference in the amount of space between the sides suggests the presence of tracheal deviation\n\n##### Assess Cricosternal Distance?\n\n##### Lymph Nodes\n\nPosition patient upright and examine from behind if possible. Use pads of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers to press and roll the lymph nodes to feel.\n\n1. Inspect for any obvious evidence of lymphadenopathy\n2. Start in submental area and progress through various lymph node chains\n   ![|325](z_attachments/325.png)\n\nCauses include [[Lung Tumours]] [[Tuberculosis]] and [[sarcoidosis]]\n\n## Face\n\n#### General\n\n- **Plethoric complexion:** a congested red-faced appearance associated with polycythaemia (e.g. [[COPD]]) and $CO_2$ retention (e.g. [[Respiratory Failure#Type II|type II respiratory failure]]).\n\n#### Eyes\n\n- **Conjunctival pallor:** suggestive of underlying anaemia*.* Ask the patient to gently pull down their lower eyelid to allow you to inspect the conjunctiva.\n- **Ptosis, miosis and enophthalmos:** all features of [[Horner's Syndrome]] (anhydrosis is another important sign associated with the syndrome). Horner’s syndrome occurs when the sympathetic trunk is damaged by pathology such as lung cancer affecting the apex of the lung (e.g. Pancoast tumour).\n\n#### Mouth\n\n- **Central cyanosis:** bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia.\n- **Oral candidiasis:** a fungal infection commonly associated with steroid inhaler use (due to local immunosuppression). It is characterised by pseudomembranous white slough which can be easily wiped away to reveal underlying erythematous mucosa.\n\n## Chest\n\n#### Inspection\n\n- Scars - check both axillae too\n- Chest wall deformities\n  - Asymmetry\n  - Pectus excavatum - caved-in or sunken appearance\n  - Pectus carinatum - protrusion of the sternum and ribs\n  - hyperexpansion (barrel chest) associated with [[asthma]] and [[COPD]]\n\n##### Apex Beat\n\n- Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line\n- Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum\n\n##### Assess Chest Expansion\n\nCan be assessed either anteriorly or posteriorly\n\n1. Place hands around patients chest inferior to the nipples\n2. Warp fingers around other side\n3. Bring thumbs together so they touch\n4. Ask patient to breath in\n5.

The condition is characterized by the formation of small clumps of inflammatory cells, known as granulomas, in various parts of the body. Sarcoidosis can have a wide range of symptoms and can affect people of any age, gender, or ethnic background.\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nThe exact cause of sarcoidosis is still unknown. It is believed to result from an abnormal immune response triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. These factors might include infections, chemicals, or allergens. Genetic factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of developing sarcoidosis.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nSarcoidosis can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the organs involved:\n\n- **Lungs:** Persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain.\n- **Skin:** Rash, nodules, or red or discoloured patches.\n- **Eyes:** Burning, itching, redness, dryness, and in severe cases, blurred vision or even blindness.\n- **Lymph Nodes:** Enlarged and tender lymph nodes, particularly around the neck, armpits, and groin.\n- **Joints:** Joint pain and stiffness.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired and lacking energy.\n- **Fever:** Low-grade fever.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Skin Lesions:** Discoloured or raised areas of skin.\n- **Lymph Node Enlargement:** Palpable, tender lymph nodes.\n- **Eye Involvement:** Redness, swelling, or other eye-related symptoms.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nDiagnosing sarcoidosis can be complex due to its diverse manifestations. Diagnostic tests may include:\n\n- **Chest X-ray:** To identify lung involvement and granuloma formation.\n- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Measures lung capacity and function.\n- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a tissue sample (often from the lungs or skin) to confirm the presence of granulomas.\n- **Blood Tests:** To rule out other conditions and assess markers of inflammation.\n- **Eye Examination:** To detect eye involvement.\n\n## Management\n\nSarcoidosis can have a variable course, ranging from mild and self-limiting to chronic and progressive. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the organs affected:\n\n1. **Observation:** Mild cases may not require treatment and may resolve on their own.\n2. **Corticosteroids:** Prednisone and other steroids to reduce inflammation.\n3. **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** For cases not responding to corticosteroids.\n4. **Topical Treatment:** Creams or ointments for skin lesions.\n5. **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers for joint discomfort.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nSevere sarcoidosis can lead to complications:\n\n- **Organ Damage:** Chronic inflammation can damage affected organs.\n- **Scarring:** Severe lung involvement can lead to pulmonary fibrosis.\n- **Eye Complications:** Severe eye involvement can result in blindness.\n- **Heart and Nervous System Involvement:** Rare but serious complications.","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.256744483Z","tags":["Respiratory","Rheumatology","Dermatology","AIassisted"]},"/Seminoma":{"title":"Seminoma","content":"\n\nMalignant neoplasm of the testis arising form germ cells in the seminiferous tubules\nMost common type of testicular cancer\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\n- **Age:** Most common in men between 25 and 45 years of age.\n- **[[Cryptorchidism]]:** regardless of whether it was surgically corrected or only affected the other testis\n- **Family History:** Having a close relative with testicular cancer increases risk.\n\n## Clinical Features\n\n###### Local Primary Tumour Effects\n\n- Testicular lump, swelling pain\n\n###### Effects of Distant Metastases\n\n- Lung mets -\u003e SOB\n- LN mets -\u003e back pain\n\n###### Paraneoplastic Syndromes\n\n- Gynecomastia\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\n- **Physical Examination:** A healthcare provider examines the testicles for abnormalities.\n- **Ultrasound:** Imaging to visualize the testicle and assess the nature of the mass.\n- **Blood Tests:** To measure tumor markers like alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG).\n- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a tissue sample to confirm cancer.\n\n## Management\n\n1. **Surgery:** Radical inguinal orchiectomy to remove the affected testicle.\n2. **Radiation Therapy:** Targeted radiation to kill remaining cancer cells.\n3. **Chemotherapy:** For more advanced or aggressive cases.\n4. **Active Surveillance:** Monitoring for slow-growing tumors in certain cases.\n\n## Complications/red Flags\n\n- Metastasis\n- Recurrence\n- Infertility ","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.256744483Z","tags":["Urology"]},"/Sepsis":{"title":"Sepsis","content":"\nA life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection\n\nUtilises Quick SODA (qSOFA) scoring system - based on\n\n- RR\n- altered mental state\n- systolic BP\n\nSeptic shock is a subset of sepsis.

Patients will lean towards the side of the cerebellar lesion\n\t- Arm swing - often absent or reduced in [[Parkinson's disease]]\n\t- Steps - small, shuffling steps -\u003e Parkinsonian gait\n\t- Turning - patients with cerebellar disease will find this difficult\n\n**S**cars - previous surgery\n**W**asting of muscles - LMN lesion or disuse atrophy\n**I**nvoluntary movements - pseudoathetosis (proprioception failure), chorea ([[Huntington's Disease|Huntington's]]) \n**F**asciculartions - LMN pathology\n**T**remor - resting, intention... etc\n\n##### Romberg's test\nPossibly do but a positive test does **NOT** indicated cerebellar pathology - just that there is a sensory ataxia.\n1. Position yourself within arms reach of the patient to allow intervention to correct falling\n2. Ask the patient to put their feet together and keep their arms by their sides (may struggle to do this)\n3. Ask patient to close their eyes\n\n#### Objects and Equipment\n\n- Walking aids\n- Prescription\n\n### Pronator drift \n0. Ask patient to close eyes\n1. Ask patient to hold arms out with palms facing down and then ask them to turn them over \n2. Observe signs of drift for 20-30 seconds\n\nIf pronator drift occurs it indicates contralateral pyramidal tract lesion\n\n## Tone\n\nAssess tone in the muscles comparing each side \n1. Support patients limb\n2. Ask them to relax and allow you to fully control their arm\n3. Move all the muscle groups in all directions\n4. Feel for abnormalities of tone \n\nSpasticity is associated with pyramidal tract lesions ([[stroke]]) and rigidity extrapyramidal lesions\n\nSpasticity is velocity dependent - the fast the movement the worse it is\nRigidity is velocity independent - it feels the same no matter the speed that you move the limb\n\nThe two main type of rigidity are:\n- Cogwheel rigidity - intermittent increase in tone during movement of the limb. Due to a tremor + hypertonia. Associated with [[Parkinson's disease]]\n- Lead pipe rigidity - uniformly increased tone throughout the movement of the muscle. Associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome \n\n#### Ankle clonus\nInvoluntary rhythmic muscular contractions associated with UMN lesions of descending pathways ([[stroke]], [[Multiple Sclerosis|MS]], [[cerebral palsy]]). Up to 5 \"beats\" could be considered normal. \n1. Position the patient's leg so that the knee and ankle are slightly flexed, supporting the leg with your hand under their knee\n2. Rapidly dorsiflex and partially evert the foot to stretch the gastrocnemius muscle\n3. Keep the foot in this position and observe for clonus\n\n## Power\n\n1. Assess the power by stabilising and isolating the relevant joint for each assessment. Find the list [[Myotomes|here]] for each movement \n2. You must compare **both** sides at the same time.\n3. As the patient to resist the force that you apply to the joint. **Always** ensure that the force you apply is proportional to the joint - eg to test finger extension use your fingers to resist.\n4. Communicate clear instructions for each stage of the assessment. \n5. Use the MRC power assessment (below) for scoring strength\n\n| Score | Description                                    |\n| ----- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| 0     | No contraction                                 |\n| 1     | Flicker or trace of contraction                |\n| 2     | Active movement with gravity eliminated        |\n| 3     | Active movement against gravity                |\n| 4     | Active movement against gravity and resistance |\n| 5     | Normal power                                               |\n\nIt's important to know the myotomes and the spinal level associated with each movement.\n\n**UMN lesions** causes **weaker** upper limb **extensions** than the flexors \n\n**LMN lesions** cause a focal pattern - only the muscles directly innervated by the damaged nerve affected\n## Reflexes\n\nFor each reflex the patient's limb needs to be completely relaxed. A trick to ensure this can be to ask the patient to clench their teeth whilst you tap the tendon to distract their mind from the limb\n\n#### Biceps reflex (C5/6)\n1. Locate the biceps brachii tendon (antecubital fossa)\n2. Place thumb on over the tendon and then tap your thumb with the tendon hammer\n3. Observe/feel for contraction\n\n#### Supinator (brachioradialis) reflex (C5/6)\n1. Locate brachioradialis tendon on the posterolateral aspect of the wrist approx. 4 inches proximal to base of thumb\n2. With 2 fingers positioned over the tendon tap fingers with tendon hammer\n\n#### Triceps reflex (C7)\n1. Position the patient's arm so that the triceps tendon is relaxed (rest elbow 90$\\degree$ flexion on their lap and/or support forearm)\n2. Locate triceps tendon superior to olecranon of ulna\n3. Tap the tendon with the tendon hammer\n\n#### Knee-jerk reflex (L3/4)\n1. Ask patient to hang leg over side of bed. Ensure limb is completely relaxed\n2. Tap patellar tendon with tendon hammer\n\n#### Ankle-jerk reflex (S1)\n1. While on bed ask support leg so hip is slightly abducted and externally rotated. The knee should be flexed and ankle in slight dorsiflexion\n2. Tap Achilles tendon with tendon hammer\n\n#### Plantar reflex (L5-S1)\n1. Explain that you are going to scratch the foot with a blunt stick and it might feel uncomfortable but not painful. Gain consent\n2. Fix foot in position by holding ankle\n3. Run the blunt object along the lateral edge of the sole of the foot moving towards the base of little toe and then turn medially to run transverse across\n4. Observe big toe\n5. Normal result: flexion of the toes. Abnormal (Babinski sign): extension of big toe and abduction of other toes - suggestive of UMN lesion\n\n## Sensation\n\n- Ensure the patient has their eyes closed for the assessment. \n- Demonstrate normal sensation of the sternum each time. \n- Compare left to right \n- Ask the patient to say yes when they feel the sensation\n\n![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20230920110211.png|425]]\n\n#### Light touch\nInvolves both the **dorsal columns** and **spinothalamic tracts**\n- Use a wisp of cotton wool to assess sensation across the upper or lower limb dermatomes. \n\n#### Pin-prick\nInvolves the **spinothalamic tracts**\n- Repeat over same dermatomes but with sharp end of neuro-tip\n- If loss of sensation is noted distally, test for \"glove distribution\" associated with peripheral neuropathy\n\n#### Vibration\n1. Tap a 128Hz tuning fork (**not on a table or surface**) and place on patients sternum to check they can feel it\n2. Tap the fork again and place onto the interphalangeal joint. Check they can correctly identify when its vibrating and when its not\n3. If sensation impaired continue to place the fork more proximally on more bony prominences until the patient is able to accurately identify\n\n#### Proprioception\nUse a distal joint e.g. thumb or big two and hold at the edges to move to prevent pressure allowing the patient to tell\n1. Demonstrate up and down position whilst patients eyes are open \n2. Ask the patient to close their eyes and ask to say what position the joint is in\n3. Move the joint 3/4 times in a random sequence\n4. If unable to identify move to more proximal joints e.g. wrist, elbow, shoulder \n\n### Patterns of sensory loss\n\n**Mononeuropathies** result in a localised sensory disturbance in the area supplied by the damaged nerve.\n\n**Peripheral neuropathy** typically causes symmetrical sensory deficits in a ‘glove and stocking’ distribution in the peripheral limbs. The most common causes of peripheral neuropathy are [[diabetes mellitus]] and chronic alcohol excess ([[B12 deficiency]]).\n\n**Radiculopathy** occurs due to nerve root damage (e.g. compression by a herniated intervertebral disc), resulting in sensory disturbances in the associated dermatomes.\n\n**Spinal cord damage** results in sensory loss both at and below the level of involvement in a dermatomal pattern due to its impact on the sensory tracts running through the cord.\n\n**Thalamic lesions** (e.g. [[stroke]]) result in contralateral sensory loss.\n\n**Myopathies** often involve symmetrical proximal muscle weakness.\n\n\n## Coordination\n\n#### Finger to nose test\n1. Position your finger so that the patient has to fully outstretch their arm to reach it\n2. Ask the patient to touch their nose with their finger and then your fingertip\n3. Repeat this as fast as possible\n\nDifficulty could be due to cerebellar pathology. \n**Dysmetria** - lack of coordination and patient may under/overshoot\n**Intention tremor** - broad, coarse, low frequency tremor that develops as limb extends. Be careful not to mistake for action tremor which is present throughout the movement \n\n#### Dysdiadochokinesia\nInability to perform rapid alternating movements - feature of ipsilateral cerebellar pathology\n1. Ask the patient the rapidly flip one hand over in the palm of the other\n2. Observe the speed and fluency by which the patient can do this\n3. Repeat with other hand\n\n#### Heel-to-shin test\nWeakness from an UMN lesion can also produce apparent loss of coordination\n1. Ask the patient to place their left heel on their right knee and run it down their shin in a straight line\n2. Then ask them to return it to the starting position and repeat this movement\n3. Repeat this with the other leg. \n\n\n## To Complete the Exam\n\n- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.\n- **Thank the patient** for their time.\n- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.\n- **Summarise** your findings.\n\n## Further Assessments and Investigations\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-26T17:33:22.256744483Z","tags":["Examination","OSCE"]},"/Urinary-Tract-Infection":{"title":"Urinary Tract Infection","content":"\nBacteriuria - may be asymptomatic or symptomatic.
