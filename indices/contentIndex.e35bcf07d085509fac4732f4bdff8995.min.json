Typically small and mobile - sometimes called \"breast mouse\" as they move around within the breast tissue\n- More common in younger women\n- Respond to female hormones - therefore regress after menopause\n- Painless, smooth, round, well circumscribed, firm, mobile, up to 3 cm diameter\n\nFibroadenomas are not cancerous and are **not usually associated with an increased risk of  breast cancer**. However complex fibroadenomas and a positive family history of breast cancer may indicate a higher risk.\n\n## Fibrocystic changes \n\nGeneralised lumpiness to the breast - considered a variation of normal and not a disease. Connective tissue, ducts and lobules of the breast respond to the oestrogen and progesterone becoming fibrous and cystic. Fluctuate with the menstrual cycle\n\nCan vary in severity and affect QoL if severe. Management include:\n- Exclude cancer\n- Wearing a supportive bra\n- NSADs\n- Avoiding caffeine \n- Hormonal treatments under specialist guidance\n\n## Breast Cysts\n\nBenign individual fluid filled lumps. Most common cause of breast lumps between 30-50 y/o. \n\nCan be painful and may fluctuate in size over cycle\n- Smooth\n- Well-circumscribed\n- Mobile\n- Possibly fluctuant\n\nRequire further assessment to exclude cancer with imaging and potentially aspiration or excision\n\n## Fat Necrosis\nLump formed by localised degeneration and scarring of fat tissue, usually triggered by local trauma, radiotherapy or surgery with an inflammation reaction resulting in fibrosis and necrosis. Does not increase the risk of breast cancer. \n- Painless\n- Firm\n- Irregular\n- Fixed in local structures\n- May be skin dimpling or nipple inversion\n\n**_Ultrasound_** or **_mammogram_** can show a similar appearance to breast cancer.\nBiopsy may be required to confirm diagnosis\n\nUsually managed conservatively; it may resolve spontaneously with time. Surgical excision may be used if required for symptoms.\n\n## Lipoma\nBenign fat tissue tumours. Can occur almost anywhere on the body where there is adipose.\n- Soft\n- Painless\n- Mobile\n- Do not cause skin changes\n\nThey are typically treated conservatively with reassurance. Alternatively, they can be surgically removed.\n\n## Galactocele\nOccur in women thatt are lactating often after stopping breastfeeding. Occur when the lactiferous duct is blocked, preventing the gland from draining milk.\n- Firm\n- Mobile\n- Painless lump\n- Usually beneath the areola. \nBenign and resolve without treatment.

Add the scores from each component together to calculate the total GCS score, which can range from 3 (indicating severe impairment) to 15 (indicating normal neurological function).\n\n\nThe GCS is a valuable tool for assessing and monitoring patients with neurological conditions or head injuries, helping healthcare providers make informed decisions about patient care and treatment.

This disruption can be caused by various underlying medical conditions affecting the sympathetic nervous system.\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nHorner Syndrome results from interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the brain and the eye. This interruption can occur due to several causes:\n\n1. **Central Causes:** Lesions or damage to the central nervous system, often within the brainstem or spinal cord.\n2. **Preganglionic Causes:** Interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the spinal cord and the superior cervical ganglion.\n3. **Postganglionic Causes:** Disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the superior cervical ganglion and the eye.\n4. **Congenital Causes:** Some individuals are born with Horner Syndrome due to developmental issues in the sympathetic nerve pathway.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nHorner Syndrome primarily affects one side of the face and eye, resulting in the following set of characteristic symptoms:\n\n- **Ptosis:** Drooping of the upper eyelid on the affected side.\n- **Miosis:** Constricted pupil in the affected eye.\n- **Anhidrosis:** Decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Ptosis:** The drooping of the upper eyelid may be subtle or pronounced.\n- **Miosis:** The affected pupil is noticeably smaller than the unaffected pupil.\n- **Anhidrosis:** The skin on the affected side of the face may appear dry due to reduced sweating.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nTo diagnose Horner Syndrome and identify the underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:\n\n- **Imaging:** MRI or CT scans to identify lesions or abnormalities in the central or sympathetic nervous system.\n- **Underlying Cause Investigation:** Determining the root cause of Horner Syndrome through medical history, physical examination, and additional tests.\n\n## Management\n\nThe management of Horner Syndrome involves addressing the underlying cause, which may vary depending on the specific case. If Horner Syndrome is caused by an identifiable condition, treatment will be aimed at managing or treating that condition. For cases with no apparent underlying cause, close monitoring may be recommended to detect any potential changes or developments.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nHorner Syndrome itself is a set of symptoms indicating disruption of the sympathetic nervous system. The most important aspect is identifying and addressing the underlying cause, as this could be indicative of a more serious medical condition such as:\n\n- **Brainstem Lesions:** Horner Syndrome can be a sign of a lesion or injury in the brainstem.\n- **Carcinomas:** Tumours, particularly in the chest or neck, can disrupt sympathetic pathways.\n- **Aneurysms:** An aneurysm affecting blood vessels can lead to Horner Syndrome.\n- **Pancoast Tumours:** Tumours located at the top of the lungs can cause Horner Syndrome.","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.949786798Z","tags":["Neurology","AIassisted"]},"/Hyperthyroidism":{"title":"Hyperthyroidism","content":"\n\nHyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave's disease]].\n\nHyperthyroidism is increased thyroid hormone synthesis and secretion from the thyroid gland. Thyrotoxicosis is the clinical syndrome of excess circulating thyroid hormones irrespective of source. Hyperthyroidism is a subset of thyrotoxicosis \n## Causes/Factors\n\n1. **[[Grave's disease]]:** An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroid hormones. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism\n2. **Toxic Multinodular Goiter:** The thyroid gland develops multiple nodules that produce thyroid hormones independently, leading to an overproduction of hormones.\n3. **Toxic Adenoma:** A single nodule in the thyroid gland becomes overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones.\n4. **Subacute Thyroiditis:** Inflammation of the thyroid gland causes the release of stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream.\n5. **Excessive Iodine Intake:** Consuming a high amount of iodine, either through diet or medication, can lead to hyperthyroidism.\n6. **Medications:** Certain medications containing iodine or thyroid hormones can induce hyperthyroidism as a side effect.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- **Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite.\n- **Nervousness and Irritability:** Feeling anxious, jittery, or easily agitated.\n- **Heat Intolerance:** Feeling excessively hot in normal temperatures.\n- **Increased Sweating:** Perspiring more than usual, especially in the hands and feet.\n- **Tremors:** Fine trembling of the hands and fingers.\n- **Palpitations:** Rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak even without physical exertion.\n- **Muscle Weakness:** Experiencing muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs.\n- **Frequent Bowel Movements:** Having more frequent and sometimes loose bowel movements.\n- **Changes in Menstrual Patterns:** Irregular menstrual periods in women.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter):** The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.\n  - Smooth = Grave's disease\n  - Nodular = toxic nodules\n  - Tender = thyroid inflammation\n- **Tachycardia:** Abnormally fast heart rate.\n- **Exophthalmos:** In Grave's disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\n- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\n- **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity.\n- **Thyroid Scintigraphy:** Imaging test using radioactive iodine to identify nodules or areas of increased thyroid activity.\n- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland.\n- **Antibody Tests:** To detect antibodies associated with Grave's disease.\n\n## Management\n\n1. **Antithyroid Medications:** Drugs like Methimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) can lower thyroid hormone production.\n2. **Beta-Blockers:** Used to manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat and tremors.\n3. **Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** Destroys part of the thyroid gland to reduce hormone production.\n4. **Surgery (Thyroidectomy):** Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland in certain cases.\n5. **Iodine Restriction:** Limiting iodine intake to reduce hormone production in the thyroid gland.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\n- **Thyroid Storm:** A life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms, which requires immediate medical attention.\n- **[[osteoporosis]]:** Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.\n- **Heart Problems:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure.\n- **[[Pregnancy]] Complications:** Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.949786798Z","tags":["Endocrinology","AIassisted"]},"/Hypoglycaemia":{"title":"Hypoglycaemia","content":"Commonest endocrine emergency\n\nPlasma glucose \u003c3 mmol/L (but 4 is the floor to start treatment)\n\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nInsulin or sulfonylurea treatment in a diabetic.

It is usually unilateral.\n\n## Investigations\n\nProbable clinical diagnosis:\n\n\u003eA probable diagnosis of Ménière's disease requires all of the following criteria:\n\u003e- Two or more episodes of vertigo or dizziness, each lasting 20 minutes to 24 hours.\n\u003e- Fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or fullness) in the affected ear.\n\u003e- Not better accounted for by an alternative vestibular diagnosis.\n\n- Confirmation requires referral to ENT consultant and formal audiology assessment \n## Management\n\n- For acute attacks symptom management include - prochlorperazine, antihistamines (cyclizine, cinnarzine and promethazine)\n- Prophylaxis with betahistine\n\n## Complications/red Flags\n\n- Falls\n- Psychological and social impacts\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.953786793Z","tags":["ENT"]},"/Macrocytic-anaemia":{"title":"Macrocytic anaemia","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.953786793Z","tags":[]},"/Macular-degeneration":{"title":"Macular degeneration","content":"Lots of different classifications for age related macular degeneration (AMD)\n\n**Early AMD** - with low, medium or high risk of progression.

It includes:  \n- papillitis or anterior optic neuritis - the intraocular portion of the nerve is affected, and the optic disc is swollen\n- retrobulbar neuritis - optic neuritis in which the disc is not swollen\n- neuroretinitis - optic disc and adjacent temporal retina are affected\n\nThe disc changes in papilloedema may closely resemble those of papillitis but visual acuity is reduced markedly in papillitis but not in papilloedema.\n\nPatients usually have good outcomes with 90%+ recovering vision to 6/12 to better within 1 year which is sustained. However some abnormalities in contrast and colour sensitivity may persist \n\n## Causes/Factors\n\n- Most commonly associated with demyelinating diseases such as [[Multiple Sclerosis]]\n- Metabolic - vitamin deficiencies especially of B12 severe anaemia \n- Ischaemia - [[Diabetes Mellitus]], temporal arteritis, ateriosclerosis\n- Familial - Leber's disease\n- Infection:\n\t- viral - herpes zoster, infectious mononucleosis, typhoid fever\n\t- bacterial - neurosyphilis, meningitis, tuberculosis\n\t- other - toxoplasmosis\n\n## Clinical Features\n\n- Acute to subacute unilateral loss of vision (hours to days)\n- dull aching pain in the region of the eye, aggravated by movement, especially elevation\n- visual field defect - most commonly a central scotoma\n- loss of colour vision\n- relative afferent pupillary defect\n- reduced visually-evoked response\n- optic disc oedema\n## Investigations\n\n- Visual field testing\n- Colour vision assessment\n- Fundoscopy\n- Test eye movements\n- Blood tests - autoimmune markers, ESR, infection \u0026 inflammatory markers \n- MRI of brai and orbits with gadolinium contrast - shows lesions of optic nerve. May also show white matter lesions suggestive of MS. LP may support that \n\n## Management\n\nOral prednisolone was found to be ineffective and increased the risk of recurrence\n\nThe typical regimen is **intravenous methylprednisolone** 1g daily for three days followed by an **oral prednisolone taper** (1mg/kg for 11 days).\n\nOral methylprednisolone 500mg once a day for five days has been suggested as an **alternative to intravenous steroids**, but its use remains controversial.\n\n\u003e [!info]\n\u003e Treatment is **more likely** to be offered to those with a diagnosis of MS, profound visual loss in a solitary eye, or in cases of severe pain.3 It is important to consider the **significant side effects** which can be associated with high-dose steroids, and counsel the patient appropriately.\n\n## Complications/red Flags\n\n- Risk of recurrence in the affected or other eye is about 30% at 5 years \n- An episode of ON does not imply a definite conversion to MS.

Common symptoms include:\n\n- **Shortness of Breath:** Feeling breathless, especially during physical activity.\n- **Chest Pain:** Sharp or dull pain in the chest, often worsened by deep breathing or coughing.\n- **Cough:** Dry or productive cough, which may produce blood-tinged sputum.\n- **Reduced Breath Sounds:** Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side during auscultation.\n- **Fever:** Especially if the effusion is caused by infection.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak due to reduced lung function.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Dullness to Percussion:** When tapping the chest, the sound may be dull over the area of the effusion.\n- **Decreased Breath Sounds:** Reduced or absent breath sounds when listening with a stethoscope.\n- **Tracheal Shift:** The trachea may shift away from the affected side in large effusions.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nTo diagnose pleural effusion and determine its underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:\n\n- **Chest X-ray:** Provides an initial visualization of the pleural space and any fluid accumulation.\n- **Ultrasound:** Helps visualize the amount and location of fluid in real-time.\n- **CT Scan:** Offers detailed cross-sectional images for a better assessment of the pleural space.\n- **Thoracentesis:** Removal of fluid from the pleural space for analysis.\n- **Pleural Fluid Analysis:** Examination of the fluid to determine its composition and underlying cause.\n\n## Management\n\nThe management of pleural effusion depends on its underlying cause. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, remove excess fluid, and address the root cause. Treatment options include:\n\n1. **Thoracentesis:** Draining the excess fluid from the pleural space to relieve symptoms and facilitate diagnosis.\n2. **Medications:** Depending on the cause, medications such as antibiotics, diuretics, or anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed.\n3. **Treat Underlying Cause:** Addressing the condition causing the effusion, such as treating infections or managing heart failure.\n4. **Surgical Interventions:** In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to remove fluid or prevent future accumulations.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nUntreated or unmanaged pleural effusion can lead to serious complications, such as:\n\n- **Lung Collapse:** Severe effusions can compress the lung, causing it to collapse (atelectasis).\n- **Empyema:** Accumulation of pus within the pleural space due to bacterial infection.\n- **Respiratory Failure:** Severe effusion can lead to difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.953786793Z","tags":["Respiratory","AIassisted"]},"/Polycystic-Kidney-Disease":{"title":"Polycystic Kidney Disease","content":"\nPolycystic kidney disease is an inherited condition that causes small fluid-filled sacs called cysts to develop in the kidneys.\n\n#### Autosomal Dominant (ADPKD)\n\n- PKD1/2 mutation\n- Small change - present as adults\n- Rarely any symptoms with child with the condition.

These beliefs are still held, even in the face of contradictory evidence.\n\nWhilst it may be necessary to *gently challenge* a delusional belif to establish if its fixed in nature, it should be done carefully to not breakdown rapport. \n\n\u003e [!info] A common delusion is persecutory delusion, in which the patient beliees another person is trying to harm them\n\u003e - \"Do you sometimes have thoughts that others tell you are false?\"\n\u003e - \"Do you have anoy beliefs that aren't shared by others you know?\"\n\nDisorders of thought content can also be considered delusions. These include:\n- thought withdrawal (the belief that thoughts can be removed from their mind)\n- thought insertion (thoughts can be placed into their mind)\n- thought broadcasting (others can hear their thought)\n\n### Obsession and compulsions\n\nThoughts, images, or impulses that are recurrent and intrusive. They enter the mind despite resistance and recognised by the patient as their own thought.\n\nCompulsions are repetitive mental processes or physical acts a patient feels compelled to perform due to an obsession or rule to attempt to reduce the distress and anxiety associated with them. \n\nThese two symptoms are characteristic of [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]] but can occur in other illnesses. \n\n- \"Do you get repeat unpleasant thoughts or images coming into your mind\"\n- \"Do you ever feel that you need to repeatedly check things you have already done?\"\n\n### Alcohol or substance abuse\n\nThe use of alcohol or recreational drugs is common and may be a trigger for a condition, an attempt to manage the symptoms of a condition or a substance misuse disorder\n\nThere are several screening questions for alcohol use, for example, “**CAGE**“:\n\n- _“Have you ever felt you ought to **C**ut down on your drinking?”_\n- _“Have people **A**nnoyed you by criticising your drinking?”_\n- _“Have you ever felt **G**uilty about drinking?”_\n- _“Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (**E**ye-opener) to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?”_\n\nFor recreational drugs, the amount of money spent tends to be a good guide to intake. \n\n### Eating disorders\n\nThe patient uses the control of food to cope with feelings and/or other situations. Generallyinvolve eating too little or too much, purging behaviours or worrying excessively about body weight or shape \n\n\u003e [!info] Most common eating disorders are [[Anorexia nervosa]], [[Bulimia nervosa]], and binge eating disorder\n\u003e - \"Can you describe a typical day's food intake\"\n\u003e - \"How do you feel about your body?\"\n\u003e - \"What sort of exercise do you do and how much?\"\n\u003e - \"Are you sick often?\"\n\u003e - \"What do you are in a binge, are there any triggers.?

This scarring, known as fibrosis, makes it harder for the lungs to function properly and can result in breathing difficulties and reduced oxygen exchange.\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nPulmonary fibrosis can have various causes or factors, including:\n\n1. **Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF):** The most common form with an unknown cause.\n2. **Environmental Exposures:** Prolonged exposure to asbestos, silica, coal dust, or other environmental irritants.\n3. **Autoimmune Diseases:** Conditions like [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]] or systemic sclerosis can lead to lung fibrosis.\n4. **Medications:** Some medications, such as certain chemotherapy drugs or heart medications.\n5. **Genetics:** Rare genetic mutations can lead to familial forms of pulmonary fibrosis.\n6. **Infections:** Certain lung infections can result in scarring and fibrosis.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nSymptoms of pulmonary fibrosis can develop gradually and worsen over time:\n\n- **Shortness of Breath:** Initially during exertion, later even at rest.\n- **Persistent Dry Cough:** A chronic, dry cough that doesn't produce mucus.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and lacking energy.\n- **Weakness:** Reduced physical stamina and muscle strength.\n- **Unexplained Weight Loss:** Losing weight without intentional changes in diet or exercise.\n- **Chest Discomfort:** Discomfort or pain in the chest.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Crackling Sounds:** Velcro-like crackling sounds (called \"velcro rales\") heard during lung auscultation.\n- **Clubbing:** Thickening and rounding of the fingertips due to reduced oxygen levels.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nDiagnosing pulmonary fibrosis involves various tests to assess lung function and identify underlying causes:\n\n- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Measures lung capacity and how well the lungs move air.\n- **High-Resolution CT Scan (HRCT):** Provides detailed images of lung tissue to identify scarring.\n- **Bronchoscopy:** Visual examination of the airways using a thin, flexible tube.\n- **Lung Biopsy:** A tissue sample from the lung to confirm the presence of fibrosis and determine its cause.\n\n## Management\n\nThere is currently no cure for pulmonary fibrosis, but management aims to slow disease progression and improve symptoms. Treatment options include:\n\n1. **Medications:** Corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants to reduce inflammation.\n2. **Oxygen Therapy:** Supplemental oxygen to alleviate breathing difficulties and improve oxygen levels.\n3. **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** Exercise programs to improve lung function and overall fitness.\n4. **Lung Transplantation:** For severe cases, a lung transplant may be considered.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nComplications and potential consequences of untreated pulmonary fibrosis include:\n\n- **Respiratory Failure:** Advanced fibrosis can lead to severe breathing difficulties and insufficient oxygen exchange.\n- **Pulmonary Hypertension:** Increased blood pressure in the lungs due to narrowed blood vessels.\n- **Infections:** Scarring can make the lungs more susceptible to infections.","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.953786793Z","tags":["Respiratory","AIassisted"]},"/RRAPID":{"title":"RRAPID","content":"## Recognising and Responding to Acute Patient Illness and Deterioration\n\n- Life threatening problems must be treated before moving on\n- Regularly reassess \n- Call for help early\n\n#### Airway -

The condition is characterized by the formation of small clumps of inflammatory cells, known as granulomas, in various parts of the body. Sarcoidosis can have a wide range of symptoms and can affect people of any age, gender, or ethnic background.\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\nThe exact cause of sarcoidosis is still unknown. It is believed to result from an abnormal immune response triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. These factors might include infections, chemicals, or allergens. Genetic factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of developing sarcoidosis.\n\n## Symptoms\n\nSarcoidosis can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the organs involved:\n\n- **Lungs:** Persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain.\n- **Skin:** Rash, nodules, or red or discoloured patches.\n- **Eyes:** Burning, itching, redness, dryness, and in severe cases, blurred vision or even blindness.\n- **Lymph Nodes:** Enlarged and tender lymph nodes, particularly around the neck, armpits, and groin.\n- **Joints:** Joint pain and stiffness.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired and lacking energy.\n- **Fever:** Low-grade fever.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Skin Lesions:** Discoloured or raised areas of skin.\n- **Lymph Node Enlargement:** Palpable, tender lymph nodes.\n- **Eye Involvement:** Redness, swelling, or other eye-related symptoms.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\nDiagnosing sarcoidosis can be complex due to its diverse manifestations. Diagnostic tests may include:\n\n- **Chest X-ray:** To identify lung involvement and granuloma formation.\n- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Measures lung capacity and function.\n- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a tissue sample (often from the lungs or skin) to confirm the presence of granulomas.\n- **Blood Tests:** To rule out other conditions and assess markers of inflammation.\n- **Eye Examination:** To detect eye involvement.\n\n## Management\n\nSarcoidosis can have a variable course, ranging from mild and self-limiting to chronic and progressive. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the organs affected:\n\n1. **Observation:** Mild cases may not require treatment and may resolve on their own.\n2. **Corticosteroids:** Prednisone and other steroids to reduce inflammation.\n3. **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** For cases not responding to corticosteroids.\n4. **Topical Treatment:** Creams or ointments for skin lesions.\n5. **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers for joint discomfort.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\nSevere sarcoidosis can lead to complications:\n\n- **Organ Damage:** Chronic inflammation can damage affected organs.\n- **Scarring:** Severe lung involvement can lead to pulmonary fibrosis.\n- **Eye Complications:** Severe eye involvement can result in blindness.\n- **Heart and Nervous System Involvement:** Rare but serious complications.","lastmodified":"2024-02-20T17:24:34.953786793Z","tags":["Respiratory","Rheumatology","Dermatology","AIassisted"]},"/Scleritis":{"title":"Scleritis","content":"A severe sight threatening inflammatory conditions characterised by inflammation of the sclera \n\nAnterior scleritis (90% of cases)\n- Diffuse anterior - commonest (50%) and benign form - widespread inflammation of anterior sclera. **Not sight threatening and tends to resolve**\n- Nodular - erythematous tender fixed nodules in the sclera. **1 in 4 progress to necrotising scleritis**.

Tap the fork again and place onto the \u003cspan style=\"color:#ff0000\"\u003einterphalangeal joint\u003c/span\u003e. Check they can correctly identify when its vibrating and when its not\n3. If sensation impaired continue to place the fork more proximally on more bony prominences until the patient is able to accurately identify\n\n#### Proprioception\n\nUse a distal joint e.g. \u003cspan style=\"color:#ff0000\"\u003ethumb or big two and hold at the edges\u003c/span\u003e to move to prevent pressure allowing the patient to tell\n\n1. Demonstrate up and down position whilst patients eyes are open\n2. Ask the patient to close their eyes and ask to say what position the joint is in\n3. Move the joint 3/4 times in a random sequence\n4.
