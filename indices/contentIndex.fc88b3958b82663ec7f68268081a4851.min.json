Thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), play a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism. When the thyroid gland becomes overactive and releases an excessive amount of these hormones into the bloodstream, it leads to a state of hyperthyroidism. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave's disease]].\n\n## Causes/Factors\n\n1. **[[Grave's disease]]:** An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroid hormones. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism\n2. **Toxic Multinodular Goiter:** The thyroid gland develops multiple nodules that produce thyroid hormones independently, leading to an overproduction of hormones.\n3. **Toxic Adenoma:** A single nodule in the thyroid gland becomes overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones.\n4. **Subacute Thyroiditis:** Inflammation of the thyroid gland causes the release of stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream.\n5. **Excessive Iodine Intake:** Consuming a high amount of iodine, either through diet or medication, can lead to hyperthyroidism.\n6. **Medications:** Certain medications containing iodine or thyroid hormones can induce hyperthyroidism as a side effect.\n\n## Symptoms\n\n- **Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite.\n- **Nervousness and Irritability:** Feeling anxious, jittery, or easily agitated.\n- **Heat Intolerance:** Feeling excessively hot in normal temperatures.\n- **Increased Sweating:** Perspiring more than usual, especially in the hands and feet.\n- **Tremors:** Fine trembling of the hands and fingers.\n- **Palpitations:** Rapid or irregular heartbeat.\n- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak even without physical exertion.\n- **Muscle Weakness:** Experiencing muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs.\n- **Frequent Bowel Movements:** Having more frequent and sometimes loose bowel movements.\n- **Changes in Menstrual Patterns:** Irregular menstrual periods in women.\n\n## Signs\n\n- **Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter):** The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.\n  - Smooth = Grave's disease\n  - Nodular = toxic nodules\n  - Tender = thyroid inflammation\n- **Tachycardia:** Abnormally fast heart rate.\n- **Exophthalmos:** In Grave's disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.\n\n## Diagnostic Tests\n\n- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).\n- **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity.\n- **Thyroid Scintigraphy:** Imaging test using radioactive iodine to identify nodules or areas of increased thyroid activity.\n- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland.\n- **Antibody Tests:** To detect antibodies associated with Grave's disease.\n\n## Management\n\n1. **Antithyroid Medications:** Drugs like Methimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) can lower thyroid hormone production.\n2. **Beta-Blockers:** Used to manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat and tremors.\n3. **Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** Destroys part of the thyroid gland to reduce hormone production.\n4. **Surgery (Thyroidectomy):** Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland in certain cases.\n5. **Iodine Restriction:** Limiting iodine intake to reduce hormone production in the thyroid gland.\n\n## Complications/Red Flags\n\n- **Thyroid Storm:** A life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms, which requires immediate medical attention.\n- **Osteoporosis:** Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.\n- **Heart Problems:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure.\n- **[[Pregnancy]] Complications:** Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.979654403Z","tags":["Endocrinology"]},"/Eponymous-Syndromes/Eponymous-Syndromes":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags: MOCs\ntitle: Eponymous Syndromes\ndate created: Wednesday, August 2nd 2023, 6:17:22 pm\ndate modified: Wednesday, August 2nd 2023, 7:05:26 pm\n---\n```folder-index-content\n```","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.979654403Z","tags":[]},"/Gastroenterology/Alcohol-related-Liver-Disease":{"title":"Alcohol-related Liver Disease","content":"\n\n### Alcohol-related Liver Disease\n\nAlcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) refers to liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake.

Other causes include medications such as digoxin and spironolactone.\n-   **Hair loss:**¬†also caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen. General malnourishment can also result in hair loss.\n\n## Abdomen\nPosition the patient lying flat on the bed.\n\n#### Inspect\n- Scars - past surgery\n- Abdominal distension - **six f's**: fat, fluid, flatus, faeces, foetus or fucking large tumour\n- Caput medusae - engorged paraumbilical veins associated with portal hypertension\n- Striae -stretch marks - [[Liver Cirrhosis|ascites]], intrabdominal malignancy, [[Cushing's Syndrome]], obesity [[Pregnancy]]\n- Hernias - ask patient to cough\n\n\n## Abdominal Palpation\nAsk the patient if they are aware of any areas of abdominal pain (if present examine last). Keep good eye contact to look for discomfort\n\n### Light Palpation of the Abdomen\n-   **Tenderness:**¬†note the abdominal region(s) involved and the severity of the pain.\n-   **Rebound tenderness:**¬†said to be present when the abdominal wall, having been compressed slowly, is released rapidly and results in sudden sharp abdominal pain. Weakly associated with peritonitis\n-   **Voluntary guarding:**¬†contraction of the abdominal muscles in response to pain\n-   **Involuntary guarding/rigidity:**¬†involuntary tension in the abdominal muscles that occurs on palpation associated with peritonitis (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis)_._\n-   **Masses:**¬†large or superficial masses (e.g. hernias) may be noted on light palpation.\n\n\n### Deep Palpation\nWarn the patient this may feel uncomfortable - carefully monitor face\nIf any¬†**masses**¬†are identified during deep palpation, assess the following characteristics:\n\n-   **Location:**¬†note which of the nine abdominal regions the mass located within.\n-   **Size and shape:**¬†assess the approximate size and shape of the mass.\n-   **Consistency:**¬†assess the consistency of the mass (e.g. smooth, soft, hard, irregular).\n-   **Mobility:**¬†assess if the mass appears to be attached to superficial or underlying structures.\n-   **Pulsatility:**¬†note if the mass feels pulsatile, suggestive of vascular aetiology (e.g. abdominal aortic aneurysm).\n\n\n##### Palpate Liver\n1. Begin in right iliac fossa starting using flat edge of right hand\n2. Ask patient to take deep breath and begin to palpate and see if can feel edge of liver\n3. Repeat process moving 1-2cm superiorly each time\n4.  If you are able to identify the¬†**liver edge**, assess the following characteristics:\n\t-   **Degree of extension below the costal margin:**¬†if greater than 2 cm this suggests hepatomegaly.\n\t-   **Consistency of the liver edge:**¬†a nodular consistency is suggestive of cirrhosis.\n\t-   **Tenderness**: hepatic tenderness may suggest hepatitis or cholecystitis (as you may be palpating the gallbladder)\n\t-   **Pulsatility:**¬†pulsatile hepatomegaly is associated with tricuspid regurgitation.\n\n##### Palpate Gallbladder\nIn healthy individuals the gallbladder isn't usually palpable. If palpable suggests enlargement secondary to biliary flow obstruction and/or infection ([[Cholecystitis]])\n**Murphy's sign**\n1. Position fingers at the right costal margin in mid-clavicular line\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath\n3. If patient suddenly stops mid-breath due to pain, suggests [[Cholecystitis]] - Murphy's sign positive\n\n##### Palpate the Spleen\n- Same process and beginning as liver but move towards left costal margin instead of right\nIn healthy individuals you should not be able to palpate the spleen.\n\n##### Ballot the Kidneys\n1. Place hands in this position and push fingers together\n![|325](https://i.imgur.com/vrs2r7A.png)\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath and feel for kidney moving down\n3. If kidney ballotable describe size and consistency\n4. Repeat on other side\nIn healthy individuals the kidneys are not usually ballotable but in low BMI patients might be possible\n-   Bilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidneys can occur in [[polycystic kidney disease]] or [[amyloidosis]].\n-   A unilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidney can be caused by a renal tumour.\n\n##### Palpate the Aorta\n**1.**¬†Using both hands perform deep palpation just superior to the umbilicus in the midline.\n**2.**¬†Note the movement of your fingers should be superiorly not laterally which might suggest an expansile mass (AAA)\n\n##### Palpate the Bladder\nWarm might be uncomfortable and made cause the urge to go to the toilet.\nA distended bladder can be palpated in the¬†**suprapubic area**¬†arising from behind the¬†**pubic symphysis**¬†(e.g. urinary obstruction/retention). In most healthy patients who are passing urine regularly, the bladder will¬†**not**¬†be palpable.\n- Use side of left hand to palpate from umbilical region downwards\n\n\n## Abdominal Percussion\n\n##### Percuss the Liver\n1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **right costal margin** until the percussion note changes to dull\n2. Continue to percuss upward until the note changes back to resonant indicating the upper border\n3. Determine approximate size of liver\n\n##### Percuss the Spleen\n1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **left costal margin**\n2. The spleen should not be identifiable using percussion in healthy patients\n\n##### Percuss the Bladder\n1. Percuss downwards in the midline from the umbilical region towards the pubic symphysis\n2. A distended bladder will be dull to percussion\n\n##### Assess Shifting Dullness\n1. Percuss from the umbilical region to patients left flank - if dullness noted - may suggest ascitic fluid\n2. Whilst keeping fingers over the area at which the note became dull, ask patient to roll onto their side\n3. Keep patient on their side for 30 seconds and then repeat percussion over the same area\n4. If ascites is present the area should now be resonant \n\n\n## Abdominal Auscultation\n\n#### Assess Bowl Sounds\n**Auscultate**¬†over¬†**at least two**¬†**positions**¬†on the abdomen to¬†**assess bowel sounds**:\n\n-   **Normal bowel sounds:**¬†typically described as gurgling (listen to an example in our video demonstration)\n-   **Tinkling bowel sounds:**¬†typically associated with bowel obstruction.\n-   **Absent bowel sounds:**¬†suggests ileus which is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine due to a malfunction of peristalsis.\n\n#### Listen for Bruits\n**Auscultate**¬†over the¬†**aorta**¬†and¬†**renal arteries**¬†to identify¬†**vascular**¬†**bruits**¬†suggestive of turbulent blood flow:\n\n-   **Aortic bruits:**¬†auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus, a bruit here may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\n-   **Renal bruits:**¬†auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus and slightly lateral to the midline on each side. A bruit in this location may be associated with renal artery stenosis.\n\n## Legs\nAssess the patient‚Äôs¬†**lower legs**¬†for evidence of¬†**pitting oedema**¬†which may suggest¬†**hypoalbuminemia**¬†(e.g. [[liver cirrhosis]], protein-losing enteropathy).\n\n\n## To Complete the Exam\n- **Explain**¬†to the patient that the examination is now¬†**finished**.\n- **Thank the patient**¬†for their time.\n- **Dispose of PPE**¬†appropriately and¬†**wash your hands**.\n- **Summarise**¬†your findings.\n\n## Further Assessments and Investigations\n-   Check hernial orifices (e.g. if there are signs of bowel obstruction). \n-   If there is suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding perform a PR exam.\n-  To rule out testicular torsion or indirect inguinal hernia a external genitalia exam may be needed\n\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.983654439Z","tags":["Examination","OSCE","Gastroenterology"]},"/_Examinations/Cardiovascular-examination":{"title":"Cardiovascular Exam","content":"\n# Cardiovascular Exam\n\n## Introduction\n\n- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)\n- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)\n- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**\n- Explain what the examination involves\n- Gain consent to continue\n- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing\n\n## General Inspection\n\n#### Clinical Signs\n\n- **Cyanosis**\n- **Shortness of breath** (congestive [[Heart Failure]], [[Pericarditis]], [[pneumonia]], [[pulmonary embolism]])\n- Pallor - not very sensitive - paleness -\u003e anaemia (haemorrhage, chronic disease) or poor perfusion (congestive [[Heart Failure]])\n- **Malar flush** - plum red discolouration of the cheeks associated with [[Mitral stenosis]]\n- **Oedema** - lots of causes, usually in limbs (pedal) or abdomen (ascites).

If out of sync +ve test. Causes include:\n\n- Subclavian artery stenosis (e.g. compression by a cervical rib)\n- Aortic dissection\n- Aortic coarctation\n\n##### Collapsing Pulse\n\nA¬†collapsing pulse¬†is a forceful pulse that¬†**rapidly increases**¬†and subsequently¬†**collapses**.\n**_Ask patient if in any pain in shoulder as going to have to move it rapidly_**\nCauses of a collapsing pulse:\n\n- Normal physiological states (e.g. fever, pregnancy)\n- Cardiac lesions (e.g. aortic regurgitation, patent ductus arteriosus)\n- High output states (e.g. anaemia, arteriovenous fistula, thyrotoxicosis)\n\n##### Blood Pressure\n\nIn a cardiovascular examination OSCE station, you are¬†**unlikely**¬†to have to carry out a thorough blood pressure assessment due to time restraints, however, you should demonstrate that you have an awareness of what this would involve.\n\n## Neck\n\n#### Carotid Pulse\n\n##### Auscultate\n\nPrior to palpating the carotid artery need to rule out the presence of a¬†**bruit**.\n\n1. Place bell of stethoscope over carotid pulse\n2. Ask patient to take a deep breath in and hold\n3. Sound of a carotid bruit\n   ![[Carotid Bruit Sound.mp3]]\n4. The presence of a ‚Äòcarotid bruit‚Äô may, in fact, be a¬†**radiating cardiac murmur**\n\n##### Palpate\n\nIf no bruits were identified, proceed to¬†**carotid pulse palpation**:\n1.¬†Ensure the patient is positioned safely on the bed, as there is a risk of inducing reflex bradycardia when palpating the carotid artery (potentially causing a syncopal episode).\n2.¬†Place fingers on carotid\n3.¬†Assess the¬†**character**¬†(e.g. slow-rising, thready) and¬†**volume**¬†of the pulse.\n\n#### Jugular Vein\n\n##### Jugular Venous Pressure\n\nIndirect measure of central venous pressure (IJV connects to right atrium without any valves). Causes include [[Heart Failure]], [[Tricuspid regurgitation]] and constrictive [[Pericarditis]]\n\n1. Position the patient in a semi-recumbent position (at¬†45¬∞).\n2. Ask the patient to turn their head slightly to the left\n3. Inspect for evidence of IJV running between the medial end of the clavicle and the ear lobe, under the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid\n4. Measure the JVP¬†by assessing the vertical distance between the¬†**sternal angle**¬†and the¬†**top of the pulsation point of the IJV**¬†(in healthy individuals, this should be¬†**no greater than 3 cm**).\n\n##### Hepatojugular Reflux Test (not Performed in an OSCE)\n\nThe hepatojugular reflux test involves the application of pressure to the liver whilst observing for a sustained rise in JVP.\n\n- In healthy individuals, this rise should last¬†**no longer than 1-2 cardiac cycles**¬†(it should then fall).\n- If the rise in JVP is¬†**sustained**¬†and¬†**equal to or greater than 4cm**¬†this is deemed a¬†**positive result**.\n\nA¬†**positive hepatojugular reflux result**¬†suggests the¬†**right ventricle is unable to accommodate an increased venous return**, but it is¬†**not diagnostic**¬†of any specific condition. Constrictive [[pericarditis]], right and left ventricular failure and restrictive [[cardiomyopathy]] can cause a positive result\n\n## Face\n\n#### Eyes\n\n- **Conjunctival pallor:**¬†suggestive of underlying anaemia.¬†Ask the patient to gently pull down their lower eyelid to allow you to inspect the conjunctiva.\n- **Corneal arcus:**¬†a hazy white, grey or blue opaque ring located in the peripheral cornea. In older patients, the condition is considered benign, however, if patient \u003c50 - underlying hypercholesterolaemia.\n- **Xanthelasma:**¬†yellow, raised cholesterol-rich deposits around the eyes - hypercholesterolaemia.\n- **Kayser-Fleischer rings:**¬†dark rings that encircle the iris associated with [[Wilson‚Äôs disease]]. The disease involves abnormal copper processing by the liver, resulting in accumulation and deposition in various tissues (including the heart where it can cause [[cardiomyopathy]]).\n\n#### Mouth\n\n- **Central cyanosis:**¬†bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia (e.g. a right to left cardiac shunt)\n- **Angular stomatitis:**¬†a common inflammatory condition affecting the corners of the mouth. It has a wide range of causes including iron deficiency.\n- **High arched palate:**¬†a¬†feature of [[Marfan's syndrome]] which is associated with mitral/aortic valve prolapse and aortic dissection.\n- **Dental hygiene:**¬†poor dental hygiene is a risk factor for infective [[infective endocarditis]]\n\n## Chest\n\n#### Inspect\n\n- **Scars suggestive of previous thoracic surgery**\n- **Pectus excavatum:**¬†a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest.\n- **Pectus carinatum:**¬†protrusion of the sternum and ribs.\n- **Visible pulsations:**¬†a forceful apex beat may be visible secondary to underlying ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n### Palpation\n\n##### Apex Beat\n\n- Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line\n- Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum\n\n##### Heaves\n\nA¬†**parasternal heave**¬†is a precordial impulse that can be palpated.\n\n- Place the¬†**heel of your hand**¬†parallel to the¬†**left sternal edge**¬†(fingers vertical) to palpate for heaves.\n- If heaves are present you should feel the heel of your hand being¬†**lifted**¬†with each systole.\n- Parasternal heaves are typically associated with¬†**right ventricular hypertrophy**.\n\n##### Thrill\n\nA¬†**thrill**¬†is a¬†**palpable vibration**¬†caused by¬†**turbulent blood flow**¬†through a heart valve (a thrill is a palpable murmur).\nYou should assess for a thrill across¬†**each of the heart valves**¬†in turn\n\n![|475](https://i.imgur.com/WyvSOOE.png)\n\n### Auscultation\n\n1. Palpate the carotid pulse to determine the first heart sound.\n2. Auscultate ‚Äòupwards‚Äô through the valve areas using the¬†**diaphragm**¬†of the stethoscope whilst continuing to palpate the carotid pulse:\n\n- **Aortic valve:**¬†2nd intercostal space at the right sternal edge.\n- **Pulmonary valve:**¬†2nd intercostal space at the left sternal edge.\n- **Tricuspid valve:**¬†4th or 5th intercostal space at the lower left sternal edge.\n- **Mitral valve:**¬†5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line.\n\n3.

Start in submental area and progress through various lymph node chains\n   ![|325](https://i.imgur.com/qtL8CRj.png)\n\nCauses include [[Lung Tumours]] [[Tuberculosis]] and [[sarcoidosis]]\n\n## Face\n\n#### General\n\n- **Plethoric complexion:**¬†a congested red-faced appearance associated with polycythaemia (e.g. [[COPD]]) and $CO_2$¬†retention (e.g. [[Respiratory Failure#Type II|type II respiratory failure]]).\n\n#### Eyes\n\n- **Conjunctival pallor:**¬†suggestive of underlying anaemia*.*¬†Ask the patient to gently pull down their lower eyelid to allow you to inspect the conjunctiva.\n- **Ptosis, miosis and enophthalmos:**¬†all features of [[Horner‚Äôs syndrome]] (anhydrosis is another important sign associated with the syndrome). Horner‚Äôs syndrome occurs when the sympathetic trunk is damaged by pathology such as lung cancer affecting the apex of the lung (e.g. Pancoast tumour).\n\n#### Mouth\n\n- **Central cyanosis:**¬†bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia.\n- **Oral candidiasis:**¬†a fungal infection commonly associated with steroid inhaler use (due to local immunosuppression). It is characterised by pseudomembranous white slough which can be easily wiped away to reveal underlying erythematous mucosa.\n\n## Chest\n\n#### Inspection\n\n- Scars - check both axillae too\n- Chest wall deformities\n  - Asymmetry\n  - Pectus excavatum - caved-in or sunken appearance\n  - Pectus carinatum - protrusion of the sternum and ribs\n  - hyperexpansion (barrel chest) associated with [[asthma]] and [[COPD]]\n\n##### Apex Beat\n\n- Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line\n- Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum\n\n##### Assess Chest Expansion\n\nCan be assessed either anteriorly or posteriorly\n\n1. Place hands around patients chest inferior to the nipples\n2. Warp fingers around other side\n3. Bring thumbs together so they touch\n4. Ask patient to breath in\n5. Movement of thumbs should move symmetrically upwards \u0026 outwards\n\n![|400](https://i.imgur.com/dkoH8vZ.png)\n![|400](https://i.imgur.com/zheZOpf.png)\n\n### Percussion of Chest\n\n- **Resonant:**¬†a normal finding\n- **Dullness:**¬†suggests increased tissue density (e.g. cardiac dullness, consolidation, tumour, lobar collapse).\n- **Stony dullness:**¬†typically caused by an underlying [[pleural effusion]]\n- **Hyper-resonance:**¬†the opposite of dullness, suggestive of decreased tissue density (e.g. [[pneumothorax]]).\n\n### Auscultate Lung Fields\n\nAsk the patient to relax and breathe deeply in and out through their mouth\n\n- Apices should be auscultated through the bell\n- Auscultate symmetrically\n  Normal vesicular breathing:\n  ![[normal breathing.mp3]]\n\n#### Quality of Breath Sounds\n\n- **Vesicular:**¬†the normal quality of breath sounds in healthy individuals.\n- **Bronchial:**¬†harsh-sounding (similar to auscultating over the trachea), inspiration and expiration are equal and there is a pause between. This type of breath sound is associated with consolidation.\n\n#### Added Sounds\n\n- **Wheeze:**¬†often associated with [[asthma]], [[COPD]] and [[bronchiectasis]] - **lower airways**\n  ![[wheeze.mp3]]\n- **Stridor:**¬†a high-pitched extra-thoracic breath sound¬†resulting from¬†turbulent airflow through narrowed **upper airways**. Stridor has a wide range of causes, including foreign body inhalation (acute) and subglottic stenosis (chronic).\n  ![[inspiratory stridor.mp3]]\n- **Coarse crackles:**¬†associated with [[pneumonia]], [[bronchiectasis]] and pulmonary oedema.\n  ![[coarse crackles.mp3]]\n- **Fine end-inspiratory crackles:**¬† associated with [[pulmonary fibrosis]]\n  ![[fine crackles.mp3]]\n\n##### Vocal Resonance\n\n1. Ask the patient to say \"99\" each time stethoscope is placed down in the same tone\n2. Auscultate all major regions comparing each side\n\n**Increased volume**¬†over an area suggests increased tissue density (e.g. consolidation, tumour, lobar collapse).\n\n**Decreased volume**¬†over an area suggests the presence of fluid or air outside of the lung (e.g. pleural effusion, pneumothorax).\n\n# Repeat All of above for Posterior Chest\n\nExcept apex beat and chest expansion if already done\n\n## Final Steps\n\n- Assess for **sacral** and **pedal oedema**\n- Assess calves for signs of [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]]\n- Inspect for evidence of [[erythema nodosum]], which can be associated with [[sarcoidosis]]\n\n## To Complete the Exam\n\n- **Explain**¬†to the patient that the examination is now¬†**finished**.\n- **Thank the patient**¬†for their time.\n- **Dispose of PPE**¬†appropriately and¬†**wash your hands**.\n- **Summarise**¬†your findings.\n\n## Further Assessments and Investigations\n\n- Check **oxygen saturation $SpO_2$** and provide if needed\n- Check other vital signs - temp \u0026 blood pressure\n- Take a sputum sample\n- **For [[asthma]]** - perform a peak flow\n- Request chest X-Ray if abnormalities noted\n- Take ABG if indicated\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.983654439Z","tags":["Examination","OSCE","Respiratory"]},"/_Examinations/Upper-and-Lower-Limb-Neurological-Exam":{"title":"Upper and Lower Limb Neurological Exam","content":"\n# Upper and Lower Limb Neurological Exam\n\n## Introduction\n\n- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)\n- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)\n- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**\n- Explain what the examination involves\n- Gain consent to continue\n- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing\n\n## General Inspection\n\n#### Clinical Signs\n\n- Watch gait as they walk in/ask them to walk\n\n#### Objects and Equipment\n\n- Medical equipment - oxygen, ECG, medications, catheters (note volume and colour), IV access\n- Mobility aids\n- Pillows - congestive [[heart failure]] patients typically suffer from orthopnoea\n- Vital sign charts\n- Fluid balance charts\n- Prescription\n\n## Hands\n\n#### Inspection\n\n-\n\n## To Complete the Exam\n\n- **Explain**¬†to the patient that the examination is now¬†**finished**.\n- **Thank the patient**¬†for their time.\n- **Dispose of PPE**¬†appropriately and¬†**wash your hands**.\n- **Summarise**¬†your findings.\n\n## Further Assessments and Investigations\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.983654439Z","tags":["Examination","OSCE","Incomplete"]},"/_Examinations/_Examinations":{"title":"Untitled Page","content":"---\ntags: MOCs\ntitle: _Examinations\ndate created: Wednesday, August 2nd 2023, 6:17:10 pm\ndate modified: Wednesday, August 2nd 2023, 7:05:24 pm\n---\n```folder-index-content\n```","lastmodified":"2023-08-02T18:15:06.983654439Z","tags":[]}}
