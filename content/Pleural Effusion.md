Pleural effusion is a medical condition characterized by the accumulation of excess fluid in the pleural space. This buildup of fluid can compress the lungs, leading to breathing difficulties and other symptoms.
## Causes/Factors

Pleural effusion can result from various underlying causes, including:

1. **Infections:** Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections affecting the lungs, such as [[pneumonia]] or [[Tuberculosis]].
2. **Congestive [[Heart Failure]]:** Weakened heart function can lead to fluid accumulation in the lungs.
3. **Cancer:** Lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers can cause pleural effusion.
4. **[[pulmonary embolism]]:** Blood clots in the lungs can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup.
5. **Liver or Kidney Disease:** Impaired liver or kidney function can disrupt fluid balance and cause effusion.
6. **Inflammatory Conditions:** Conditions like [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus|lupus]] or [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|rheumatoid arthritis]] can lead to inflammation and fluid buildup.
7. **Trauma:** Chest injuries or surgeries can result in pleural effusion.
8. **Certain Medications:** Some drugs can cause fluid retention.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of pleural effusion can vary depending on the amount of fluid present and the underlying cause. Common symptoms include:

- **Shortness of Breath:** Feeling breathless, especially during physical activity.
- **Chest Pain:** Sharp or dull pain in the chest, often worsened by deep breathing or coughing.
- **Cough:** Dry or productive cough, which may produce blood-tinged sputum.
- **Reduced Breath Sounds:** Decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side during auscultation.
- **Fever:** Especially if the effusion is caused by infection.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak due to reduced lung function.

## Signs

- **Dullness to Percussion:** When tapping the chest, the sound may be dull over the area of the effusion.
- **Decreased Breath Sounds:** Reduced or absent breath sounds when listening with a stethoscope.
- **Tracheal Shift:** The trachea may shift away from the affected side in large effusions.

## Diagnostic Tests

To diagnose pleural effusion and determine its underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:

- **Chest X-ray:** Provides an initial visualization of the pleural space and any fluid accumulation.
- **Ultrasound:** Helps visualize the amount and location of fluid in real-time.
- **CT Scan:** Offers detailed cross-sectional images for a better assessment of the pleural space.
- **Thoracentesis:** Removal of fluid from the pleural space for analysis.
- **Pleural Fluid Analysis:** Examination of the fluid to determine its composition and underlying cause.

## Management

The management of pleural effusion depends on its underlying cause. Treatment aims to alleviate symptoms, remove excess fluid, and address the root cause. Treatment options include:

1. **Thoracentesis:** Draining the excess fluid from the pleural space to relieve symptoms and facilitate diagnosis.
2. **Medications:** Depending on the cause, medications such as antibiotics, diuretics, or anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed.
3. **Treat Underlying Cause:** Addressing the condition causing the effusion, such as treating infections or managing heart failure.
4. **Surgical Interventions:** In some cases, surgical procedures may be necessary to remove fluid or prevent future accumulations.

## Complications/Red Flags

Untreated or unmanaged pleural effusion can lead to serious complications, such as:

- **Lung Collapse:** Severe effusions can compress the lung, causing it to collapse (atelectasis).
- **Empyema:** Accumulation of pus within the pleural space due to bacterial infection.
- **Respiratory Failure:** Severe effusion can lead to difficulty breathing and reduced oxygen levels.
