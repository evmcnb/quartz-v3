# Fallot's Tetralogy

Most common cyanotic congenital heart disorder + most common one that survives to adulthood

Tetralogy features:

- Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
- [[Pulmonary stenosis]]
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Overriding aorta (aorta more central in heart and accepts right sided blood)

## Causes/Factors

- Congenital (both environmental and genetic factors)
- Severity of illness depends greatly on degree of pulmonary stenosis

## Symptoms

- With closure of ductus arteriosus infants become more cyanotic due to decreasing flow of blood to the lungs and increasing right to left flow across VSD
- Difficulty in feeding/gaining weight
- Delayed growth
- Dyspnoea of exertion

## Signs

- Children may squat during hypercyanotic spell as it increases systemic vascular resistance and temporary reversal of shunt
- Pulmonary murmur

## Diagnostic Tests

- Echo demonstrates abnormal anatomy
- ECG can also show hypertrophy
- Cardiac CT shows clearer anatomy valuable for surgery

## Management

- Oxygen
- Surgery to repair VSD and replace pulmonary valve

## Complications/red Flags

- pulmonary regurgitation
- RV outflow tract obstruction
