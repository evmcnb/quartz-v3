# Deep Vein Thrombosis

Where a blood clot forms in a deep vein usually due to pooling of that blood due to lack of movement. Rarely embolises to lungs

## Causes/Factors

- **Virchows triad**:
  - Stasis of blood
  - Endothelial damage
  - Hypercoagulability
- Age
- Genetic ([[Factor V Leiden]])
- [[Pregnancy]]
- $\uparrow$ Oestrogen levels (combined oral contraceptive)
- Trauma/surgery
- Cancer
- past DVT
- smoking
- hypertension (sheering force on vessels)
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- obesity

## Symptoms

- Swelling of right or left calf - very rare to be both
- Pain in calf
- Possible no symptoms until respiratory distress

## Signs

Physical exam generally unreliable as similar to dermatitis

- Swelling and redness of leg
- Dilation of surface veins
- Pitting oedema
- Mild temperature
- Tenderness over veins when gentle pressure applied

## Diagnostic tests

- Wells Score
- D-dimer, -ve excludes DVT but +ve does not confirm
- Ultrasound of leg - shows reduced venous flow
- Thrombophilia test - before starting anticoagulant therapy

## Management

- Immediate: Low molecular weight heparin
- 3 to 6 months: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin
- Compression stockings
- Early and regular walking

## Complications/red flags

- [[pulmonary embolism]]
