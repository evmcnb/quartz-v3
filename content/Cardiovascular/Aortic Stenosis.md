# Aortic Stenosis

Aortic stenosis - stiffening, narrowing

Pressure overload - high resistance low reps -> hypertrophy

## Causes/Factors

- Congenital: bicuspid aortic value
- Calcification of the valve causing narrowing
- Age 65+

## Symptoms

- [[Angina]]
- Breathlessness on exercise
- Pre-syncope/syncope

## Signs

- Hard and loud ejection systolic murmur Between S1 and S2
- Reduced pulse pressure (difference between systolic and diastolic)
- Forceful apex beat

## Diagnostic tests

- Echocardiogram - left hypertrophy with poor valve movement possible regurgitation
- ECG - poor R wave progression and stuff which I don't understand yet

## Management

If pressure difference between ventricle and aorta remains below 60 mmHg the patient is kept under observation

- If ventricle starts to dilate valve replacement is considered
- Valve replacement is either via open heart surgery or via Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
- TAVI is going to be standard in future esp for older people
