Some medications require good kidney function. During sick days or periods of dehydration they should be stopped to preserve the kidneys. Stop for 3 days and see if illness improves - keep stopped if fluid intake is not enough

OSCE stations could sneakily ask you write up a drug chart for a dehydrated patient which includes some of these drugs which you would be expected to recognised and stop. 
## MAND

**M**etformin - dehydration increases the risk of lactic acidosis
**A**CEi/**A**RBs - impair kidney function
**N**SAIDs - impair kidney function
**D**iuretics - worsen dehydration
