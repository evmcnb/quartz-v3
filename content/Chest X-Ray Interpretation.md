###### Quick check

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010115405.png|450]]


## 1. Patient details
- Name, DoB
- When the CXR was taken
- Where it was taken 
- Any previous images for that patient 

## 2. Quality of image

#### Rotation
- The medial parts of the two clavicles should be equal distance from the spine
- Spinous processes should be vertical

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010101726.png|300]]

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010101811.png|300]]
#### Inspiration
- 5 to 7 anterior ribs or at least 9 posterior ribs
- Inspiratory effort could be gauged
- Poor inspiration can **mimic** **cardiomegaly** 
- Crowding of vessels at the base of the lungs can mimic consolidation or collapse and often occurs in acutely unwell patients

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010101859.png|325]]

#### Projection
- AP/PA?
- Most CXR are PA
- Can tell if AP if scapulae projected over lung fields

#### Exposure
- Correct definition and quality in image. 
- Can tell if can see vertebrae behind the heart

## 3. Clinical findings - ABCDE

#### Airway
1. Trachea
	-  PUSH - any increase in volume - significant [[pneumothorax]] or [[Pleural Effusion]] exhibit _mass effect_
	- PULL - loss in volume - lung collapse
2. Carina and bronchi
	- Right bronchus is straighter and wider than the left $\uparrow$ risk for aspiration
3. Hilar regions
	- Check for abnormal vessels, or enlarged lymph nodes
	- Bilaterally enlargement suggests [[Tuberculosis]] or [[Sarcoidosis]]
	- If unilateral think [[Lung Tumours]]

#### Breathing

Zones are used instead of lobes when localising a lesion

Lack of any lung markings $\rightarrow$ [[pneumothorax]]

Pleura are only visible if they become thickened or fluid accumulates (e.g. mesothelioma)


Lung opacities are described as **nodular**, **reticular** (network of fine lines, interstitial) or **alveolar** (fluffy). A single nodule may be called a space-occupying lesion

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010120036.png|325]]

**Nodules** - if >3cm across it becomes a pulmonary mass
- Neoplasia: metastases, lung cancer, hamartoma, adenoma
- Infections: varicella pneumonias, septic emboli, abscess, hydatid
- Granulomas: [[Tuberculosis]], [[Sarcoidosis]], histoplasmosis
- Pneumoconiosis (except asbestosis)

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010115306.png|325]]


**Reticular opacification** - lung parenchymal changes
- Acute interstitial oedema
- Infection: acute (viral, bacterial), chronic (TB, histoplasmosis)
- Fibrosis: interstitial pneumonia, drugs (methotrexate, bleomycin, crack cocaine), connective tissue disorders, systemic sclerosis, [[Industrial dust diseases]], [[interstitial lung disease]]

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010120103.png|325]]


**Alveolar opacification** - can be due to any material filling the alveoli
- Pus - pneumonia
- Blood - haemorrhage, DIC
- Water - heart, renal or liver failure, ARDS, smoke inhalation, heroin, $O_2$ toxicity, near drowning
- Cells - lymphoma, adenocarcinoma
- Protein - alveolar proteinosis, ARDS, fat emboli

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010120504.png|325]]

_Ring opacities_ - either from a CT cross section referring to [[bronchiectasis]]/[[bronchitis]] or cavitating lesions on CXR

_Linear opacities_ - septal lines (Kerley B lines, i.e. interlobular lymphatics seen with something), atelectasis, pleural plaques

_White out of whole hemithorax_ - [[pneumonia]], large pleural effusion, ARDS, post pneumonectomy


#### Cardiac

- Should be less than 50% of the overall thoracic window
- Boarders should be clearly defined - usually consolidation would change this
- 1/3 should lie to the right of the vertebral column, 2/3 to the left
- May appear elongated if the chest is hyperinflated [[COPD]] or enlarged in AP or if there is [[Heart Failure|LV failure]] or pericardial effusion


#### Diaphragm 

- The right side is often slightly higher due to liver
- Costophrenic angles should be well defined and acute
- Blunting can be caused by hyperinflation of fluid collections

#### Everything
- Damage to bony structures
- Dislocations
- Lytic lesions
- Presence of extra features - double left heart boarder (left lower lobe collapse)
- Breast shadows or lack of them
- Artificial shadows: wires/leads/tubes/artificial valves/pacemakers/past sternotomy 


## Examples of pathological scans

##### Lobar [[pneumonia]] (typical Strep. pneumoniae)
![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010122446.png|450]]
##### Atypical pneumonia (mycoplasma)
![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010122550.png|425]]
##### Aspiration pneumonia (can move depending on position)
![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010122619.png|425]]

##### [[Tuberculosis]]
Ghon lesion - left middle lobe
Calcified lymph nodes

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231010122720.png|425]]

##### Miliary tuberculosis

Check ribs for invasive lesion
