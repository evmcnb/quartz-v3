Primary adrenal cortical insufficiency - not enough steroid hormones

- Autoimmune is most common form
- Treat with long term steroid replacement

Triad of **hyperpigmentation**, **postural hypotension** and **hyponatraemia**


## Causes/Factors

- Autoimmune 
- Infections - [[Tuberculosis]], fungal infections
- Genetic factors - rarely genetic mutations

## Symptoms

- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Muscle weakness/twitching
- Low BP when standing
- Hyperpigmentation

## Diagnostic Tests

- Blood test - measure cortisol and aldosterone levels
- ACTH stimulation test - to assess if adrenal glands release in response to hormone 
- Imaging - CT to see glands

## Management

Patients need to carry round an emergency card or bracelet to let people know what to do if they cannot 
1. Glucocorticoid replacement - hydrocortisone/prednisone to replace cortisol
2. Mineralcorticoid replacement - fludrocortisone to replace aldosterone 
3. Salt supplementation? 


## Complications/red Flags

- Adrenal crisis - life threatening situation, extreme weakness and low BP - requires hydrocortisone injection immediately 
- Electrolyte imbalance - hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia
