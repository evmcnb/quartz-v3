## Anti-platelet

- **_Aspirin_** - prevents production of thromboxane A2 inhibiting platelet aggregation. Used in low doses (75mg/day PO) for secondary prevention following [[myocardial infarction]], [[Transient Ischemic Attack]] and [[Stroke]]. Also used for patients with [[Angina]] or [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Also an NSAID and may worsen GI symptoms.  
- ***P2Y12 antagonists*** - (clopidogrel, pasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet aggregation but cause less gastric irritation. Used with aspirin after PCI, and in [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]]

## Anticoagulants

- ***DOACs*** - Xa inhibitors (apixaban), direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) for treatment of [[Atrial Fibrillation]] and clots. 
- Warfarin is still used for people with mechanical heart valves
- Anticoagulants used in [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]] include LMWH, fondaparinux (Xa inhibitor) & bivalirudin (thrombin inhibitor)

## $\beta$ blockers

- Antagonise the sympathetic nervous system
- Blocking $\beta_1$ is negatively inotropic and chronotropic
- Blocking $\beta_2$ induces peripheral vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction
- Propanolol is non selective, bisoprolol is $\beta_1$ selective
- Used in [[Angina]], [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]], post [[myocardial infarction]], [[Heart Failure]]
- Contraindicated in _severe_ [[asthma]]/[[COPD]], [[Heart Block]]

## ACEi 

- Causes vasodilation and excretion of sodium and water. eg Ramipril 
- Used in [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]], [[Heart Failure]], post [[myocardial infarction]]
- Can cause hyperkalaemia 
- Put pressure on the kidneys so hold in [[Acute Kidney Injury]] and monitor U&Es for kidney function
- Can cause a dry cough so may switch to ARB (ARB contraindicated in pregnancy however)

## Diuretics

- _**Loop diuretics**_ - eg furosemide inhibit NA/2Cl/K co-transporter. $\downarrow$ Na$^+$ $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\downarrow$ Ca$^{2+}$. [[Heart Failure]]
- **_Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics_** are used in [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]] (indapamide) and [[Heart Failure]] (metolazone). $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\uparrow$ Ca$^{2+}$ $\downarrow$ Mg$^{2+}$, $\uparrow$ urate ($\pm$ gout).
- _**Potassium sparing diruetics**_ - aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) 

## Vasodilators 

- Used in [[Heart Failure]], [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]],   
- ***Nitrates*** - preferentially dilate veins and large arteries. $\downarrow$ preload (filling pressure)
- ***Hydralazine*** - primarily dilate resistance vessels $\downarrow$ after-load (BP)
- ***Prazosin*** - $\alpha$-blocker dilates veins and arteries

## Calcium antagonists 

- $\downarrow$ cell entry of Ca$^{2+}$ in smooth muscle, promoting coronary and peripheral vasodilation and reducing myocardial oxygen use. All current drugs block L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels but different binding properties cause different effects. [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]] and [[Angina]]
- ***Dihydropyridines*** - eg _amlodipine_ are mainly peripheral vasodilators and cause a reflex tachycardia so used with a $\beta$-blocker
- ***Non-dihydropyridines*** - eg _verapamil and diltiazem_ slow conduction at the AV and SV node and may be used to treat dysrhythmias in addition. 

> [!info] Don't give non-dihydropyridines with $\beta$-blockers for risk of severe bradycardia

## Digoxin

- Blocks the Na+/K+ pump. Used to rate control in fast [[Atrial Fibrillation|AF]] (aim for less than 100)
- Weak +ve inotrope, half life of 36 hours
- $\uparrow$ Toxicity risk if $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\downarrow$ Mg$^{2+}$ or $\uparrow$ Ca$^{2+}$
- May caused ST depression in toxicity [[ECG Lead Placement & Interpretation#^20b905|Digoxin effect]]

## Sodium channel blockers

- Class I anti-arrhythmics 
- ***Procainamide (1a) and Lidocaine (1b)*** can be used to terminate VT
- ***Flecainide (1c)*** is useful for [[Atrial Fibrillation]] cardioversion and for anti-arrhythmia prophylaxis
- Contraindicated in [[Heart Failure]], [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]], [[Heart Block]], and valve disease

## Amiodarone

- Class III anti-arrhythmic
- Prolongs cardiac action potential reducing the chance for tacharrythmias 
- Used in SVT and VT 
- Broad side effects - thyroid disease, liver disease, [[Pulmonary Fibrosis]] and peripheral neuropathy 
- Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months 

## Ivabradine

- Blocks the pacemaker funny current (small current to give the heart a push to make a contraction). So slows pulse rate without significantly dropping blood pressure
- [[Angina]], [[Heart Failure]] and off licence in autonomic tachycardia syndromes
- CI in acute [[myocardial infarction]], long QT, bradycardia.
- Many drug interactions including with calcium antagonists

## Statins

- Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase preventing de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes leading to $\downarrow$ LDL cholesterol.
- More effective if given at night
- Generally v well tolerated
