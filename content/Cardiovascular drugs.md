# Anti-arhythmic classes

1. Class I Antiarrhythmics: Class I drugs primarily affect sodium channels and can be further subdivided into three subclasses based on their effects on sodium channels:
    - Class IA: These drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide) prolong the action potential duration and are used to treat atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.
    - Class IB: These drugs (e.g., lidocaine, mexiletine) have little effect on action potential duration and are used primarily for ventricular arrhythmias.
    - Class IC: Drugs like flecainide and propafenone that have minimal effects on action potential duration and are used for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

2. Class II Antiarrhythmics: Class II drugs are beta-blockers (e.g., propranolol, metoprolol, and atenolol) that reduce sympathetic stimulation of the heart. They are used to treat tachyarrhythmias by slowing down the heart rate and reducing the risk of arrhythmias.
    
3. Class III Antiarrhythmics: Class III drugs primarily affect potassium channels, delaying repolarization of the cardiac cells and prolonging the action potential duration. Examples of Class III antiarrhythmics include amiodarone, sotalol, and dofetilide. These drugs are used to treat a variety of arrhythmias, including atrial and ventricular.
    
4. Class IV Antiarrhythmics: Class IV drugs are calcium channel blockers (e.g., verapamil and diltiazem). They slow the conduction of electrical signals in the heart by blocking calcium channels. They are primarily used to treat atrial arrhythmias and can also help control ventricular rate in conditions like atrial fibrillation.
    
5. Other Antiarrhythmics: There are other antiarrhythmic agents that don't fit neatly into the Vaughan Williams classification, including adenosine, digoxin, and some newer drugs. Adenosine is used to terminate certain types of supraventricular tachycardias. Digoxin can be used to control the ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation but is not a first-line antiarrhythmic. Newer agents like dronedarone have been developed and have unique mechanisms of action.


## Anti-platelet

- **_Aspirin_** - prevents production of thromboxane A2 inhibiting platelet aggregation. Used in low doses (75mg/day PO) for secondary prevention following [[myocardial infarction]], [[Transient Ischemic Attack]] and [[Stroke]]. Also used for patients with [[Angina]] or [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Also an NSAID and may worsen GI symptoms.  
- ***P2Y12 antagonists*** - (clopidogrel, pasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet aggregation but cause less gastric irritation. Used with aspirin after PCI, and in [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]]

## Anticoagulants

- ***DOACs*** - Xa inhibitors (apixaban), direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) for treatment of [[Atrial Fibrillation]] and clots. 
- Warfarin is still used for people with mechanical heart valves
- Anticoagulants used in [[Acute Coronary Syndrome]] include LMWH, fondaparinux (Xa inhibitor) & bivalirudin (thrombin inhibitor)

## $\beta$ blockers

- Antagonise the sympathetic nervous system
- Blocking $\beta_1$ is negatively inotropic and chronotropic
- Blocking $\beta_2$ induces peripheral vasoconstriction and bronchoconstriction
- Propanolol is non selective, bisoprolol is $\beta_1$ selective
- Used in [[Angina]], [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]], post [[myocardial infarction]], [[Heart Failure]]
- Contraindicated in _severe_ [[asthma]]/[[COPD]], [[Heart Block]]

## ACEi 

- Causes vasodilation and excretion of sodium and water. eg Ramipril 
- Used in [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]], [[Heart Failure]], post [[myocardial infarction]]
- Can cause hyperkalaemia 
- Put pressure on the kidneys so hold in [[Acute Kidney Injury]] and monitor U&Es for kidney function
- Can cause a dry cough so may switch to ARB (ARB contraindicated in pregnancy however)

## Diuretics

- _**Loop diuretics**_ - eg furosemide inhibit NA/2Cl/K co-transporter. $\downarrow$ Na$^+$ $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\downarrow$ Ca$^{2+}$. [[Heart Failure]]
- **_Thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics_** are used in [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]] (indapamide) and [[Heart Failure]] (metolazone). $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\uparrow$ Ca$^{2+}$ $\downarrow$ Mg$^{2+}$, $\uparrow$ urate ($\pm$ gout).
- **_Potassium sparing diruetics**_ - aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone, eplerenone) 

## Vasodilators 

- Used in [[Heart Failure]], [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]],   
- ***Nitrates*** - preferentially dilate veins and large arteries. $\downarrow$ preload (filling pressure)
- ***Hydralazine*** - primarily dilate resistance vessels $\downarrow$ after-load (BP)
- ***Prazosin*** - $\alpha$-blocker dilates veins and arteries

## Calcium antagonists 

- $\downarrow$ cell entry of Ca$^{2+}$ in smooth muscle, promoting coronary and peripheral vasodilation and reducing myocardial oxygen use. All current drugs block L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels but different binding properties cause different effects. [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]] and [[Angina]]
- ***Dihydropyridines*** - eg _amlodipine_ are mainly peripheral vasodilators and cause a reflex tachycardia so used with a $\beta$-blocker
- ***Non-dihydropyridines*** - eg _verapamil and diltiazem_ slow conduction at the AV and SV node and may be used to treat dysrhythmias in addition. 

> [!info] Don't give non-dihydropyridines with $\beta$-blockers for risk of severe bradycardia

## Digoxin

- Blocks the Na+/K+ pump. Used to rate control in fast [[Atrial Fibrillation|AF]] (aim for less than 100)
- Weak +ve inotrope, half life of 36 hours
- $\uparrow$ Toxicity risk if $\downarrow$ K$^+$ $\downarrow$ Mg$^{2+}$ or $\uparrow$ Ca$^{2+}$
- May caused ST depression in toxicity [[ECG Lead Placement & Interpretation#^20b905|Digoxin effect]]

## Sodium channel blockers

- Class I anti-arrhythmics 
- ***Procainamide (1a) and Lidocaine (1b)*** can be used to terminate VT
- ***Flecainide (1c)*** is useful for [[Atrial Fibrillation]] cardioversion and for anti-arrhythmia prophylaxis
- Contraindicated in [[Heart Failure]], [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]], [[Heart Block]], and valve disease

## Amiodarone

- Class III anti-arrhythmic
- Prolongs cardiac action potential reducing the chance for tacharrythmias 
- Used in SVT and VT 
- Broad side effects - thyroid disease, liver disease, [[Pulmonary Fibrosis]] and peripheral neuropathy 
- Monitor TFTs and LFTs every 6 months 

## Ivabradine

- Blocks the pacemaker funny current (small current to give the heart a push to make a contraction). So slows pulse rate without significantly dropping blood pressure
- [[Angina]], [[Heart Failure]] and off licence in autonomic tachycardia syndromes
- CI in acute [[myocardial infarction]], long QT, bradycardia.
- Many drug interactions including with calcium antagonists

## Statins

- Inhibit HMG-CoA reductase preventing de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver. This increases LDL receptor expression on hepatocytes leading to $\downarrow$ LDL cholesterol.
- More effective if given at night
- Generally v well tolerated
