The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), ulcerative colitis and [[Crohn's Disease]] are chronic autoimmune relapsing and remitting inflammation of the intestine.

Can only effect colon - "never" past ileocaecal value

Extra intestinal manifestations

## Causes/Factors

Inappropriate immune response against (?abnormal) colonic flora in genetically susceptible individuals - failure to maintain tolerance

## Symptoms

- Episodic or chronic diarrhoea $\pm$ mucus/blood
- Abdominal discomfort
- Bowel frequency relates to severity
- Systemic symptoms in attacks: pyrexia, malaise, anorexia
- Smoking improves condition possibly

## Signs

- May be none
- Acute severe UC fever, tachycardia, distended abdomen
- Nocturnal symptoms

Extraintestinal signs:

- [[clubbing]]
- Aphthous oral ulcers
- [[erythema nodosum]]
- [[pyoderma gangrenosum]]
- episcleritis
- large joint arthritis
- ankylosing spondylitis
- nutritional deficits

## Diagnostic Tests

- Calprotectin - protein released from neutrophils into stool -> inflammatory marker, highly sensitive
- Blood tests for inflammatory markers/anaemia (FBC, ESR, CRP, U&E, LFT)
- Full colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy -> biopsy
- AXR - no feacal shadows, mucosal thickening/islands

## Management

Goals are to induce and maintain disease remission
![|650](z_attachments/650.png)

**Immunomodulation** if patients flare on steroid or require 2+ courses of steroid per year. Monitor LFTs. Slow acting drug compared to steroids

**Biologic therapy** for patients intolerant of immunomodulation or developing symptoms despite an immunomodulator

**Surgery** - needed at some stage in 20% of cases to remove effected part of colon

## Complications/red Flags

- toxic dilation of colon (perforation risk)
- [[venous thromboembolism]]
- colon cancer
