#### Type I

hypoxia ($PaO_2 < 8kPa$) with a normal or low $PaCO_2$. Its caused primarily by V/Q mismatch, hypoventilation, abnormal diffusion, right to left cardiac shunts. Eg of V/Q mismatch:

- [[pneumonia]]
- [[pulmonary oedema]]
- [[pulmonary embolism]]
- [[asthma]]
- [[emphysema]]
- [[pulmonary fibrosis]]
- [[ARDS]]

#### Type II

^35e872

hypoxia with hypercapnia ($PaCO_2 < 6kPa$). Caused by alveolar hypoventilation with or without V/Q mismatch. Causes include:

- Pulmonary disease: [[asthma]], [[COPD]], [[pneumonia]], [[pulmonary fibrosis]], [[obstructive sleep apnoea]]
- Reduced respiratory drive: sedatives, CNS tumour/trauma
- Neuromuscular disease: Cervical chord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, [[poliomyelitis]], [[myasthenia gravis]], [[Guillain-Barre Syndrome]]
- Thoracic wall disease: fail chest, [[kyphoscoliosis]]

### Clinical Features

Features are of underlying cause plus symptoms of hypoxia with or without hypercapnia

Hypoxia: dyspnoea, restlessness, agitation, confusion, central cyanosis - if chronic/long standing pulmonary hypertension, [[polycythaemia]], [[cor pulmonale]]

Hypercapnia: headache, peripheral vasodilation, tachycardia, bouncing pulse, confusion, drowsiness, coma

## Diagnostic Tests

Find underlying cause

- Blood tests
- CXR
- Sputum culture
- Spirometry

## Management

Treat underlying cause

- oxygen
- assisted ventilation if necessary

## Complications/red Flags
