# Cerebral infarction

Two types - ischemia or haemorrhagic

Ischemic - clot blocks supply to distal parts of brain to where that clot got lodged
Haemorrhagic - bleeding in the brain causing lack of perfusion (plus irritation to that part of brain)

Ischemia can lead to haemorrhagic (haemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke )

## Causes/Factors

- Cardiac emboli ([[Atrial Fibrillation]])
- Atherothromboembolism (from carotids)
- Aneurism
- Anticoagulation/thrombolysis
- [[Transient Ischemic Attack]]

### DDX

- Head injury
- Hypo/hyperglycaemia
- Tumour

## Signs

- Worst at onset
- Severe headache
- Maybe contralateral or hemiplegia
  - face - weakening/drooping
  - arms - weakness
- Slurred speech
- 5 syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor and dysarthria/clumsy head

## Diagnostic tests

- CT/MRI rapidly to differentiate between ischemic or haemorrhagic
  Looking for source of clot
- ECG to look for AF
- BP for hypertension
- Echo for atherothromboembolism in carotid and AF
- Glucose to rule out hypo/hyperglycaemia

## Management

- Protect airway from aspiration
- Maintain homeostasis

Once haemorrhagic excluded:

- Thrombolysis considered if >4.5h since symptom onset
- Thrombectomy (cerebral angioplasty)
- Antiplatelets for 2 weeks after (aspirin)

For a bleed, coiling (endovascular embolization) can be used to stop further bleeding. Surgery can also be done to remove excess blood and reduce intracranial pressure
