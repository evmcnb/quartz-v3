# Cystic Fibrosis

1 in 25 people carry the mutation - autosomal recessive. Mutation in CFTR gene on chromosome 7

## Causes/Factors

Purely genetic condition, mutation leads to defect in chloride ion channel causing thickened mucus

### Clinical Features

- Neonates: failure to thrive, rectal prolapse
- Children: cough, wheeze, recurrent infections, [[bronchiectasis]], [[pneumothorax]], haemoptysis
- Adult: male infertility, [[osteoporosis]], [[Osteoarthritis]], [[vasculitis]], abnormal bowel movements
- Loss of Islets of Langerhans cells (insulin) -> CF related diabetes
- **[[clubbing]] of fingers**
- Cyanosis

## Diagnostic tests

- Sweat test: high levels of NaCl present in sweat
- Genetic screening

## Management

- Multidisciplinary
- Physiotherapy - airway clearance techniques
- Antibiotics for recurrent infections
- Nebulised mucolytics (DNase) / saline
- Bronchodilators

## Complications/red flags

- Low prognosis - median ~41 years
