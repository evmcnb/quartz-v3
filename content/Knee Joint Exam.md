## Introduction

- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves
- Gain consent to continue

## Look

- Ask the patient to expose their legs before beginning the exam
- Look for any redness, swelling, inflammation etc
- Look for any signs of muscle wastage - particularly in the quadriceps 
- Scars or deformities
- Any walking aids - how did they walk into the consultation?

## Feel

- Feel the skin temperature of both legs at the same time with back of hand
- Palpate for tenderness along the joint line and patella
- Feel behind the knee for popliteal (Baker's) cyst
- Assess for effusion by performing patella tap

## Move

- Ask the patient to actively extend and flex the joint to maximum and establish RoM and if there is any pain
- Then ask the patient to relax and passively move the joint with one hand on the patella to feel for crepitus
- Place hand under knee and ask patient to straighten this leg to check for any flixed flexion deformity 
- Check for ACL and PCL stability by sitting on foot and pulling forwards and backwards - not trying to illicit pain but looking for physical movement of the joint
- Test MCL and LCL by trying to move leg in both directions with the other hand acting as a pivot
- **McMurray’s test** - half flex and internally rotate the leg to test the lateral meniscus
