Type IV hypersensitivity reaction against tubules/interstitium

IT IS NOT [[acute tubular necrosis]] (ATN) - direct epithelial damage due to toxins/ischaemia

## Causes/Factors

- **Medications:** Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), can trigger an immune response leading to inflammation.
- **Infections:** Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause tubulointerstitial nephritis.
- **Autoimmune Disorders:** Conditions like [[systemic lupus erythematosus]] (SLE) and [[Sj√∂gren's syndrome]] can lead to inflammation in the kidney.
- **Toxins:** Exposure to certain toxins and heavy metals can damage kidney tubules.
- **Idiopathic:** In some cases, the exact cause may not be identified.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of tubulointerstitial nephritis can vary and may include:

- **Fatigue:** Generalized tiredness and weakness.
- **Reduced Urine Output:** Decreased urine production.
- **Swelling:** Edema, particularly around the eyes, hands, and feet.
- **Frequent Urination:** Increased need to urinate, especially at night.
- **Blood in Urine:** Hematuria (blood in the urine) may be present.

## Signs

- **Fluid Retention:** Visible edema and swelling.
- **Reduced Urine Output:** Decreased frequency and volume of urination.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing tubulointerstitial nephritis involves several tests:

- **Urinalysis:** Detects abnormalities in the urine, including blood and protein.
- **Blood Tests:** Assess kidney function, levels of waste products, and inflammation markers.
- **Kidney Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a kidney tissue sample to determine the cause and extent of inflammation.

## Management

Treatment of tubulointerstitial nephritis depends on the underlying cause:

1. **Discontinuation of Causative Agents:** If medications are the cause, discontinuing the offending drugs.
2. **Infection Treatment:** Treating underlying infections with appropriate medications.
3. **Immunosuppressive Therapy:** For cases related to autoimmune disorders.
4. **Supportive Care:** Managing symptoms and promoting kidney health.
5. **Diet and Fluid Management:** Adjusting salt and fluid intake.

## Complications/Red Flags

- **[[Chronic Kidney Disease]]:** Prolonged inflammation can lead to kidney damage and impaired function.
- **[[Acute Kidney Injury]]:** Sudden and severe kidney dysfunction may occur.
- **Recurrence:** Tubulointerstitial nephritis can recur if underlying causes are not adequately addressed.
