- **Virchows triad**:
  - Stasis of blood
  - Endothelial damage
  - Hypercoagulability

- Age
- Genetic ([[Factor V Leiden]])

- Mild temperature
- Tenderness over veins when gentle pressure applied

## Diagnostic Tests

- Wells Score
- D-dimer, -ve excludes DVT but +ve does not confirm
- Ultrasound of leg - shows reduced venous flow
- Thrombophilia test - before starting anticoagulant therapy

## Management

- Immediate: Low molecular weight heparin
- 3 to 6 months: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) or warfarin
