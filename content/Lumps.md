# History & Exam

- How long has it been there? 
- Does it hurt?
- Any other symptoms, eg itch? 
- Any other lumps 
- Is it getting bigger
- Otherwise well?

**6S's of skin lesions**

1. Site
2. Size
3. Shape
4. Smoothness
5. Surface
6. Surroundings

- Does it tranilluminate?
- Fixed/tethered?
- Fluctuant/compressible?
- Temperature
- Tender?
- Pulsatile

| Intradermal    | Subcutaneous |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| Sebaceous cyst | Lipoma       |
| Abscess        | Ganglion     |
| Dermoid cyst   | Neuroma      |
| Granuloma      | Lymph node             |
If a lump is intradermal you cannot draw the skin over it, while if the lump is subcutaneous, you should be able to manipulate it independently from the skin


## Lipomas

- Benign fatty lumps that occur wherever fat can expand (not scalp or palms)
- Smooth imprecise margins
- Slightly fluctuant 
- Not fixed
- Symptoms usually due to pressure
- Very rarely malignant change
- **Dercum's disease** - multiple scattered lipomas which may be painful - typically in post-menopausal women

## Sebaceous cysts

- Either epidermal or pilar cysts (not of sebaceous origin and contain keratin not sebum)
- Firm, round, mobile subcutaneous nodules of varying size
- Characteristic central punctum 
- Infection common - pus exits through centre
- Treatment of bad ones is excision of cyst and contents

<small>Epidermal</small>

## Keratosis

#### Solar (actinic) keratosis 
- Sun-exposed skin sites
- Crumbly, yellow-white crusts
- Malignant change to [[Squamous cell carcinoma]] may occur after several years
- Cryotherapy, fluorouracil, imiquimod

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110132625.png|350]]

#### Seborrheic keratosis

- Looks scary but benign skin growth
- Look waxy or scaly and slightly raised. They appear gradually, usually on the face, neck, chest or back.
- Usually appear in numbers rather than a single lesion like in [[Melanoma]]

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110132226.png|293]]

#### Keratosis pilaris


![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110132415.png|350]]


## Cutaneous abscesses

- Staphylococci most common organism. 
- Below the waist faecal organisms are common 
- Treatment incise and drain 
- Think [[Hidradenitis suppurativa]] if recurrent inguinal or axillary abscesses 

#### Boils (furuncles)
- Abscesses involving hair follicle and associated glands

#### Carbuncle
- An area of subcutaneous necrosis which discharges itself on to the surface through multiple sinuses 

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110130207.png|375]]

## Rheumatoid nodules 

- Collagenous granulomas which appear in established RA
- On the extensor aspects on the joints - esp elbows

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110130438.png|375]]

## Ganglia 

- Degenerative cysts from an adjacent joint or synovial sheath
- Commonly seeon on the dorsum of the wrist, hand or foot.
- May transilluminate
- 50% disappear spontaneously
- Bible smacker

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110130812.png|500]]

## Dermatofibromas

- Can occur anywhere in body
- Most commonly under skin
- Whitish, benign tumour containing collagen, fibroblasts and fibrocytes

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110131005.png]]

## Dermoid cyst

- Contain dermal structures
- Found at junction of embryonic cutaneous boundaries eg midline or lateral to eye

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110131130.png]]

## Malignant tumours of connective tissues
- Fibrosarcoma, liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas
- TNM grading
- Needle-core biopsies 
- Refer to specialist

## Neurofibromas 

- Caused by [[Neurofibromatosis]]
- Autosomal dominant inheritance - expression of NF1 is variable even within a family 

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110131301.png|300]]

## Keloids

- Irregular hypertrophy of vascularised collagen forming rainsed edges at sites of previous scars that extend outside the scar
- Common in dark skin 
- Treatment can be difficult - intralesional steroid injections 

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231110131642.png|375]]


## Keratoacanthomas

- Fast-growing benign, self-limitting papule plugged with keratin
- May be confused with [[Squamous cell carcinoma]]
