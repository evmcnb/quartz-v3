Arrhythmias are:
1. common
2. often benign (but may reflect underlying cardiac disease)
3. often intermittent
4. occasionally severe



## Causes/Factors

**Cardiac**
- [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]]
- Structural changes
- Cardiomyopathy
- [[Pericarditis]]
- [[Myocarditis]]

**Non-cardiac**
- Caffine
- Smoking
- Alcohol
- Pneumonia
- Drugs ($\beta$ agonists, digoxin, L-dopa, tricyclics)
- Metabolic imbalance (K, Ca, Mg, hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, thyroid)

## Presentation

- Palpitations
- Chest pain
- Presyncope/syncope
- Hypotension
- Pulmonary oedema

## History

- Take a detailed history of papitations
- Ask SOCRATES basically 
- Review drug history
- Ask about PMH + FH of cardiac disease or sudden death
- Syncope during exercise is always concerning
## Diagnostic Tests

- Bloods - FBC, U&E, glucose, TSH
- ECG - ischaemic changes, PR interval, long QT, U Waves
- Possible 24h cardiac monitoring

## Management

- Some can be managed conservatively e.g. reducing alcohol intake
- Drugs
- Pacemakers & ICDs
- Ablation


### Regular rate tachycardias

See [[ECG Lead Placement & Interpretation]] for more

Narrow complex is atrial in origin (SVT) - broad complex is ventricular (VT)
