- $\beta$-lactam (cell wall synthesis inhibitors)
- More modifiable than penicillins so $\therefore$ largest group of available antibiotics
- The higher the generation the wider the spectrum 

### Considerations
- Decreased first line use due to risk of C. diff
- False +ve urinary glucose and Coomb's test

| Antibiotic | Indications |  
| ------- | -------| 
| Cefalexin (1st gen) | Gram +ve infection |
| Cefuroxime (2nd gen) | Gram +ve & -ve |
| Ceftriaxone (3rd gen) | Meningococcus, broad spectrum (**not** Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Bacteroides) |
| Ceftazidime (3rd gen) | Broad spectrum including Pseudomonas, but $\downarrow$ activity against Gram +ve, empirical treatment against neutropenic sepsis
