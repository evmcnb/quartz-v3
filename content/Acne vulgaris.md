Acne vulgaris is a common skin condition characterized by the presence of comedones (blackheads and whiteheads), papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts. It usually affects areas with a high density of sebaceous glands, such as the face, chest, and back.

## **Causes/Factors:**

- **Excess Sebum Production:** Overproduction of oil by sebaceous glands.
- **Clogged Hair Follicles:** Resulting in the formation of comedones.
- **Bacterial Infection:** Propionibacterium acnes.
- **Hormonal Changes:** Especially during adolescence.
- **Genetic Factors:** Family history may contribute.

## **Clinical Presentation:**

- **Comedones:** Open (blackheads) and closed (whiteheads).
- **Inflammatory Lesions:** Papules, pustules, nodules, and cysts.
- **Scarring:** In severe cases or if lesions are manipulated.

## **Treatment:**

### 1. **Topical Treatments:**

- _Retinoids (e.g., Tretinoin, Adapalene):_ Unclog pores and promote cell turnover.
- _Benzoyl Peroxide:_ Kills bacteria and reduces inflammation.
- _Topical Antibiotics:_ (e.g., Clindamycin) to control bacterial growth.

### 2. **Oral Medications:**

- _Oral Antibiotics:_ (e.g., Doxycycline) for moderate to severe acne.
- _Hormonal Therapy:_ (e.g., oral contraceptives) for females with hormonal acne.
- _Isotretinoin:_ Reserved for severe, resistant cases due to potential side effects.

### 3. **Procedures:**

- _Extraction of Comedones:_ Manual removal of blackheads and whiteheads.
- _Chemical Peels:_ Promote exfoliation and unclog pores.
- _Laser Therapy:_ Targets bacteria and reduces sebum production.

### 4. **Skincare:**

- _Gentle Cleansing:_ Avoid harsh scrubs that can worsen inflammation.
- _Non-comedogenic Products:_ Use skincare and makeup products that won't clog pores.

### 5. **Lifestyle Modifications:**

- _Dietary Changes:_ Some evidence suggests a link between diet and acne.
- _Stress Management:_ Stress can exacerbate acne.

## **Complications/Red Flags:**

- **Scarring:** Especially in severe or untreated cases.
- **Psychosocial Impact:** Acne can significantly impact self-esteem and mental health.
