### Appearance

Observe the patient’s **general** **appearance**:

### Behaviour

Note if the patient appears **engaged** in the consultation and if you can develop a **rapport** with them.
- If they appear distracted or appear to be responding to hallucinations
- do the patients make eye contact?
- facial expression & if that's appropriate for the topic of conversation
- Any abnormal movements/tics/restlessness

### Speech

- Flow, tone and volume - rate and quantity
- Is it spontaneous?
- Comprehensive answers?
- Any tangential or circumstantial speech
- Mania is generally loud and all over the place, depression quiet and 

### Mood

Subjective - how does person think about themselves
- "How are you feeling?"
- "What's your current mood?"

Objective - how do you view the person?
- Whats their apparent emotion (affect)
	- Fixed affect: the patient’s affect remains the same throughout the interview, regardless of the topic.
	- Restricted affect: the patient’s affect changes slightly throughout the interview, but doesn’t demonstrate the normal range of emotional expression that would be expected.
	- Labile affect: characterised by exaggerated changes in emotion which may or may not relate to external triggers. Patients typically feel like they have no control over their emotions.
- How intense is this affect?
- Does this agree with their thoughts

Affect - expression of emotions on face

### Insight

One of the most complex areas of psychiatry

- Does the person understand that they're ill
