Inadequate closure of the aortic valve during diastole that allows for reverse blood flow through the aortic valve - putting increases load on the left ventricle
 


## Causes/Factors

**Acute**
- [[Endocarditis|Infective endocarditis]]
- Ascending aortic dissection
- Chest trauma

**Chronic**
- Congenital abnormality 
- Connective tissue disorders [[Marfan's syndrome]], [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]]
- [[Rheumatic fever]]
- [[Takayasu arteritis]]
- [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|RA]]
- [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]]
etc

## Symptoms

- Exertional dyspnoea 
- Orthopnoea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea

## Signs

- Collapsing pulse (water-hammer)
- Wide pulse pressure
- Displaced, hyperdynamic apex beat
- High pitched early diastolic murmur (heard best in exspiration sat forward)
- Corrigan's sign (carotid pulsation), de Musset's sign (head nodding with each beat), Quincke's sign (capillary pulsations), Duroziez's sign, Traube's sign (pistal shot sound over the femoral arteries)

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Echocardiogram:** Diagnostic if seen
- **ECG**: LVH
- **Chest X-ray:** Cardiomegaly, dilated ascending aorta, pulmonary oedema
- **Cardiac Catheterisation:** Assess severity of lesion, anatomy of aortic root, LV function, CAD, other valve disease

## Management

Main target of medical therapy is to reduce systolic hypertension
- ACEi helpful
- Echo every 6-12 months to monitor
- For TAVI if enlarged ascending aorta, increasing symptoms, enlarging LV, deteriorating LV function on echo, [[Endocarditis|Infective endocarditis]] refractory to therapy 
- Open heart surgery if not suitable to TAVI

Aim to replace the valve before significant LV dysfunction - poor post-operative prognosis is EF <50%.
