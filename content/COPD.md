- Chronic _obstructive_ pulmonary disease
- A common slowly progressive disorder characterised by airway obstruction
- Little to no reversibility (how to differentiate from [[asthma]])
- Includes chronic [[bronchitis]] and [[emphysema]]
- Patients usually have either COPD or asthma not both

Pink puffers and blue bloaters - likely ends of the spectrum:

**Pink puffers - emphysema**

- have $\uparrow$ alveolar ventilation near normal $PaO_2$ and a normal or low $PaCO_2$
- breathless but not cyanosed
- may progress to [[Respiratory Failure#Type I]]

**Blue bloaters - chronic bronchitis**

- have $\downarrow$ alveolar ventilation with a low $PaO_2$ and a normal or low $PaCO_2$
- cyanosed but not breathless
- may go on to develop [[cor pulmonale]]
- respiratory centres relatively insensitive to $CO_2$ and rely on hypoxic drive to maintain respiratory effort

### Causes

Smoking, pollution

## Symptoms

- Productive cough
- Dyspnoea
- Wheeze

## Signs

- Tachypnoea
- Use of accessory muscles for respiration
- Hyperinflated chest
- Decreased breath sounds

## Diagnostic Tests

- Spirometry: $FEV_1 < 80\%$ predicted, $FEV_1/FVC$ **ratio <0.7**
- CXR: hyperinflation, large central pulmonary arteries
- ABG: $\downarrow PaCO_2 \pm$ hypercapnia

## Management

- short acting $\beta_2$ agonist (SABA)
- short acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA)
- corticosteroid
- mucolytics
- Long-term $O_2$ therapy (NICE guidelines)

### Complications

- [[polycythaemia]]
- [[Respiratory Failure]]
- [[pneumothorax]]
- [[cor pulmonale]]
