Common chronic inflammatory condition affecting the margin of the eyelids

Mixed anterior and posterior can occur

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20240207125654.png|425]]

## Causes/Factors

**Anterior blepharitis** - inflammation of the base of the eyelashes - caused by **bacteria** (usually staph) or **seborrhoeic dermatitis** 

**Posterior blepharitis** - **inflammation of meibomian glands** - set of glands that run along the posterior eyelid margin 
- Produce a lipid section which provides the lipid layer of the tear film.
- Caused by a blockage of dysfunction of the gland

## Symptoms

Anterior: 
- Redness and swelling of the eyelid margins
- Crusting and scaling at the base of the eyelashes 

Posterior:
- Meibomian gland dysfunction leading to evaporative dry eye symptoms
- Ocular irritation and discomfort

## Signs

Anterior:
- Presence of collarettes (dandruff-like flakes) at base of eyelashes
- Eyelid margin inflammation with erythema

Posterior:
- Meibomian gland orifice plugging with thickened meibum
- Conjunctival injection and corneal findings in severe cases

## Investigations

- **Clinical exam** - eyelid evaluation under magnification
- **Meibography**: Imaging technique to visualize the meibomian glands and assess glandular dropout.
- **Tear Film Assessment**: Evaluation of tear quality and quantity to identify associated dry eye syndrome.

#### DDx
- malignant tumours of the eyelid (such as squamous cell, basal cell, or sebaceous cell carcinoma)
- eczema
- infection
- infestation (such as pubic lice) 
- autoimmune disease (such as pemphigoid).

## Management

- Advising the person of the chronic nature of the condition and the need for maintenance treatment
- eyelid hygiene measures and warm compresses
- Consideration of topical antibiotics (chloramphenicol) if hygiene measures have failed

## Referral (with urgency depending on the clinical situation) is indicated if:

- There are symptoms of corneal disease or an eye becomes painful and/or red.
- There is loss of vision.
- Orbital or pre-septal cellulitis is suspected.
- There is persistent localised disease or eyelid asymmetry (to exclude eyelid malignancy).
- An underlying condition requiring management in secondary care (such as [[Sjögren's syndrome]] or pemphigoid) is suspected.
- There are ongoing symptoms despite optimal treatment in primary care.
- The diagnosis is uncertain.
