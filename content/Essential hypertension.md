95% of all hypertension without a clear underlying medical cause. It is the most important risk factor for pre-mature death and CVD. 

To define hypertension the value is set at where anything above that would significantly increase risk and the benefit of treatment would be clear. Multiple measurements are needed to diagnose.

General people with consistent BP of >140/90 are considered to have hypertension.

Patient may have *"White coat hypertension"* - being at the doctors is an inherently nervous experience so $\uparrow$BP. In this case may ask a patient to record their blood pressure at home

_Malignant_ hypertension is a rapid rise in BP leading to vascular damage (fibrinoid necrosis). Usually there is severe hypertension (>200/130) + bilateral retinal haemorrhages $\pm$ papilledema. May be headache and visual disturbances. May cause [[Acute Kidney Injury]], [[Heart Failure]] or encephalopathy

_Secondary_ hypertension can be due to:
- Renal diseases which causes a imbalance in RAAS hormones. 
- Endocrine diseases: [[Cushing's Syndrome]], [[Conn's Syndrome]], etc
- Other causes: coarctation, [[Pregnancy]], liquorice, some drugs
## Causes/Factors

- **Genetics:** Family history of hypertension can increase the risk.
- **Lifestyle Factors:** Unhealthy lifestyle choices, including a high-salt diet, obesity, lack of physical activity, and excessive alcohol consumption.
- **Age:** The risk of hypertension increases with age.
- **Race:** Some racial and ethnic groups are more prone to hypertension.
- **Stress:** Chronic stress can lead to elevated blood pressure.

## Symptoms

- Usually completely asymptomatic and relies on good monitoring of patients to catch early 

## Diagnostic Tests

- ABPM
- 24h BP monitoring 
- Fasting glucose and cholesterol to check for CVD risk factors

## Management

Treat all >160/100. For those at 140/90 treatment depends on other comorbidities and risks but is usually done so. 

> [!tip] Treatment goals
> - <140/90 in general population
> - <130/80 in diabetics
> - 150/90 if ages over 80

- **Life style changes** - Stop smoking, low-fat diet, reduce alcohol and salt intake, increase exercise and try to lose weight

## Complications/red Flags

Malignant hypertension - oral therapy unless encephalopathy or cardiac failure. Aim for controlled BP reduction over days not hours. Avoid sudden drops in BP as cerebral autoregulation is poor. Bed rest + atenolol or long-acting CCBs

If encephalopathy monitor with arterial probe and look at guidance for IV medications needed.
