Glomerulonephritis, often referred to as GN, is a group of kidney diseases that involve inflammation of the glomeruliâ€”the tiny filtering units in the kidneys responsible for removing waste and excess fluid from the blood. Can be due to autoimmune processes

## Causes/Factors
- **Immune System Abnormalities:** Immune responses targeting the glomeruli.
- **Infections:** Certain infections (like streptococcal infection) can trigger immune responses leading to GN.
- **Autoimmune Diseases:** Conditions like lupus or Goodpasture's syndrome.
- **[[Vasculitis]]:** Inflammation of blood vessels affecting the glomeruli.
- **Hereditary Factors:** Some forms of GN have a genetic component.

## Symptoms

[[Nephrotic syndrome]]

- oedema
- hypoalbuminemia
- proteinuria >3.5g/day

[[Nephritic syndrome]]

- [[Acute Kidney Injury]]
- **haematuria** present
- proteinuria (non-nephrotic)
- [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]]
- Post-streptococcal
- Vasculitis

## Signs

- **Fluid Retention:** Swelling in various body parts due to edema.
- **High Blood Pressure:** Hypertension.
- **Urinalysis Findings:** Hematuria, proteinuria, frothy urine

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Urinalysis**
- **Blood Tests:** To assess kidney function and look for signs of inflammation, immunological investigations.
- **Kidney Biopsy**

## Management

1. **Immune System Modulation:** Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications.
2. **Blood Pressure Control:** Medications to manage hypertension and protect the kidneys.
3. **Diuretics:** To manage edema.
4. **Dietary Modifications:** Managing sodium and protein intake.
5. **Dialysis:** In severe cases of kidney failure.

## Complications/red Flags

- **[[Chronic Kidney Disease]]:** Progressive damage can lead to reduced kidney function.
- **[[Nephrotic syndrome]]:** Severe proteinuria, edema, and low protein levels.
- **[[Acute Kidney Injury]]:** Sudden decline in kidney function.
