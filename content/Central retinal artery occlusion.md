Sudden blockage of the central retinal artery leading to ischaemia of the inner retina 

Ophthalmologic emergency

## Causes/Factors

Anything that increases the risk of embolic events or CVD
- Embolic events - theromboemboli from the carotid artery or heart can occlude the vessel
- Atherosclerosis - buld-up of plaque in the carotid artery or ophthalmic artery
- Vasculitis - inflammatory conditions such as [[Giant cell arteritis]]
- Hypercoagulable states - [[Antiphospholipid syndrome]] or protein C/S defiency

## Clinical Features

- Sudden vision loss
- Central sctoma
- Pale and opaque retina - due to oedema
- Relative afferent pupillary defect - 


## Investigations

**Opthalmic examination**
- Cherry-red spot - characteristic finding due to contrast between pale retina and intact choroid

- Retinal arteries are irregular and appear as red threads

**Causes of event**
- Carotid doppler USS - look for stenosis or plaque in carotids
- Echocardiography - cardiac sources of emboli
- Blood tests - FBC, high ESR is suggestive of inflammatory cause

## Management

Sudden loss of vision is an ophthalmological emergency and requires immediate referral to the eye emergency department.
- Ocular massage - digital massage may dislodge the emboli
- Intraocular pressure lowering - topical medications or anterior chamber paracentesis
- IV acetazolamide 

## Complications/red Flags
- Permanent vision loss
- Contralateral eye involvement - increased risk of contralateral CRAO 
- Systemic embolic events - can be a manifestation of systemic embolic disease warranting further evaluation for stroke or myocardial infarction
