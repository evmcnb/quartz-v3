Factors that disrupt the mucus barrier or increase stomach acid increase the risk of ulceration

## Causes/Factors

**Mucus barrier disruption**
- Helicobacter pylori
- NSAIDs

**Increase stomach acid**
- Stress
- Alcohol
- Caffeine
- Smoking
- Spicy foods 

**Bleeding risk from ulcer**
- NSAIDs
- Aspirin
- Anticoagulants
- Steroids
- SSRIs 
## Presentation

- Epigastric discomfort
- Nausea and vomiting
- Dyspepsia
- Haematemesis
- Coffee ground vomit
- Melaena
- Iron deficiency [[Anaemia]]

> [!tip] Gastric vs duodenal ulcers differentiating history
> - Eating typically worsens the pain of gastric ulcers - so patients tend to lose weight due to the fear of pain on eating
> - Duodenal ulcer pain tends to improve after eating so weight stays the same or increases 

## Investigations

- OGD - endoscopy. During endoscopy a rapid urease test can be used to check for H. pylori infection. A biopsy can also be considered to exclude malignancy. 
- Stool sample - H pylori PCR
- PR exam - to check for melena  

## Management

- Stopping NSAIDs
- Treating H pylori infection - TDS amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg or metronidazole 400mg  
- Proton pump inhibitor to reduce gastric acid secretion - lansoprazole 30mg, omeprazole 20-40mg, etc 

## Complications/red Flags
- Significant bleeding
- Perforation - acute abdo pain and peritonitis requiring urgent surgery 
- Scarring and strictures - pyloric stenosis (early fullness after eating and upper abdo discomfort)
