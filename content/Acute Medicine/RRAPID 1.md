#Acute 
## Recognising and Responding to Acute Patient Illness and Deterioration

- Life threatening problems must be treated before moving on
- Regularly reassess 
- Call for help early

#### Airway - can be protected by themselves?
- Look- vomit secretions, trauma swelling foreign body 
- Listen - abnormal sounds, complete obstruction will be silent
- Feel - airflow from nose/mouth, misting of oxygen

Response to obstruction
- Call for help
- Oxygen 15L/min via non-rebreathing mask
- Basic airway manoeuvres
	- Head tilt
	- Jaw thrust (if C-Spine injury possible)
- Remove foreign body or suction visible secretions

#### Breathing - difficulty?
- Pneumonia 
- Pneumothorax 
- Pulmonary oedema 
- Asthma 
- Pulmonary embolism
- Exacerbation of COPD 
- Chest Trauma

- Look - RR, central cyanosis, working to breath, chest injury, ability to clear secretions by coughing, sweating 
- Listen - noisy breathing, ability to talk, percussion, bilateral air entry, breath sounds/ crepitations wheeze rub
- Feel - symmetry, heart rate, tracheal deviation, chest expansion

Response
- Give oxygen 
- Sit the patient up 
- Treat the underlying cause
	- nebulisers, antibiotics, chest drain 
- Order further investigations 
	- chest X-ray, arterial blood gas

#### Circulation
- Volume loss
- Pump failure
- Obstruction/reduced filling
- Vasodilation

Shock - a state of inadequate tissue perfusion
- Check BP, RR, urine output, lactic acidosis

- Look - source of blood/fluid loss, pallor, JVP, sweating, agitation, reduced consciousness
- Listen/Feel - pulse, cold peripheries (except in septic shock), prolonged cap refill time, heart sounds
-

Response to circulation problem
- Ensure airway patency 
- Give O2 15L/min via res mask
- ensure adequate breathing 
- Attach monitoring
- IV access 
- Give a fluid challenge and assess response (500mL of .9 saline over 15 mins)
	- Cautious if evidence of cardiogenetic shock 
- Treat underlying cause 

#### Disability - evaluation of a patientâ€™s neurological system
- Metabolic 
- hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, hypoxia
- Drugs 
- opioids, benzodiazepines 
- Seizures
- Raised intracranial pressure 
- head injury
- Intracranial infection 
- [[Sepsis]]

- Assess conscious level
- AVPU 
- Examine pupils
- **Check glucose**


Response
- Ensure a secure Airway 
	- consider recovery position
- Treat life threatening Breathing and Circulatory problems 
- Treat reversible causes of reduced consciousness 
	- glucose, opioid overdose and seizures
- Consider further investigations 
	- CT head, urine for toxicology or thyroid function tests

#### Exposure
- EVERYTHING ELSE
	- Head to toe exam
	- Check temperature
- Take full history and review notes/charts/investigations

### SBARR Communication
Method of communication to get all info necessary

**Situation** - who is the patient and where are they
**Background** - why where they admitted
**Assessment** - what's the current problem
**Recommendations** - what should be done? - get things ready and what might be needed
**Readback** - check that everything is correct
