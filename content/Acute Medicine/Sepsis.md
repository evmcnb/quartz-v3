# Sepsis

A life threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection

Utilises Quick SODA (qSOFA) scoring system - based on

- RR
- altered mental state
- systolic BP

Septic shock is a subset of sepsis. Profound circulatory, cellular and metabolic abnormalities

- Vasopressor requirement to maintain a MAP >65
- serum lactate level >2mmol/L

## Causes/Factors

- < 1 year and > 75 years
- very frail people
- recent trauma or surgery or invasive procedure
  - within 6 weeks
- impaired immunity due to
  - illness or
  - drugs
  - steroids, chemotherapy or immunosuppressants
- indwelling lines / catheters
- intravenous drug misusers
- any breach of skin integrity
- cuts, burns, blisters or skin infections

### Recognition

- Signs + symptoms of infection
- Be aware that people may have non-specific symptoms
- Pay particular attention to concerns expressed by the person/family
- High NEWS2 score

### High Risk Criteria

- Altered mental status
- RR >25
- New need for oxygen
- HR >130
- Systolic <90 or 40 below normal
- Not passed urine in pervious 18 hours
- Mottled or ashen appearance
- Cyanosis
- Non-blanching rash

## Diagnostic Tests

- FBC, CRP, U&E, urine culture, blood culture
- ABG or VBG
- Blood sugar

## Management

- Prompt management within 1 hour
- Sepsis6

#### BUFALO

- **B**lood cultures and septic screen
- **U**rine output - monitor hourly
  - U&Es urine culture
- **F**luid resuscitation
  - as clinically indicated
- **A**ntibiotics IV - LTHT guidelines
- **L**actate measurement - from arterial or venous blood gas
- **O**xygen to correct hypoxia

Hypovolaemia can be

- True hypovolaemia - when the rate of fluid loss exceeds net intake
  - Haemorrhage
  - Vomiting
  - Diarrhoea
- Relative hypovolaemia - when there is a decrease in the effect circulating volume
  - Sepsis - vasodilation
