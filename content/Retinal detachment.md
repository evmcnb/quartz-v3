Separation of the inner neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium which allows vitreous fluid to accumulate in the sub-retinal space

3 types of retinal detachment: 
![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20240209134832.png]]

- Rhegmatogenous is most common
- Exudative is caused by leakage of fluid often due to inflammation or malignancy
- Tractional detachment is most commonly seen in people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy - abnormal vasculature causes contraction of the vitreous which then pulls on the underlying retina

## Causes/Factors

- M > F 
- Myopia
- Family history of retinal break/detachment
- Eye trauma
- Cataract surgery
- Proliferative diabetic retinopathy 

## Clinical Features

- New onset floaters
- New onset flashes 
- Sudden-onset painless and progressive loss of visual fields
- Reduction in visual acuity, blurred or distorted vision

## Investigations

- Ophthalmic examination
- Ultrasound
- OCT

## Management

Arranging immediate referral to an ophthalmologist with retinal surgery expertise to be seen on the same day, if there are symptoms or signs of sight-threatening disease, such as visual field loss or changes in visual acuity, or fundoscopic signs of retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrhage.
- Surgical intervention - pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling or pneumatic retinopexy to reattach the retina and seal retinal breaks  
- Cryotherapy or laser photocoagulation to prevent progression of tears to detachment
- Gas or silicone oil tamponade to support reattachment
- 

## Complications/red Flags

- **Proliferative Vitreoretinopathy (PVR)**: Development of fibrous membranes on the retinal surface, leading to recurrent detachment.
- **Macular Involvement**: Detachment involving the macula can result in permanent central vision loss.
- **Hypotony**: Low intraocular pressure following surgery, leading to potential complications such as choroidal effusion or macular folds.
- **Optic Nerve Atrophy**: Long-standing retinal detachment can lead to optic nerve damage and irreversible vision loss.
