Commonest endocrine emergency

Plasma glucose <3 mmol/L (but 4 is the floor to start treatment)


## Causes/Factors

Insulin or sulfonylurea treatment in a diabetic. Increased activity, missed meal or overdose can be a cause

In non-diabetics **EXPLAIN** the mechanism:

**Ex**ogenous drugs - insulin, alcohol with no food, aspirin poisoning, ACEi, $\beta$-blockers, pentamidine, quinine sulfate, aminoglutethamide, insulin-like growth factor

**P**ituitary insufficiency 

**L**iver failure - plus rare inherited enzyme defects

**A**[[Addison's Disease|ddison's Disease]]

**I**slet cell tumours (insulinoma) and immune hypoglycaemia (anti-insulin receptor anti-bodies in [[Hodgkin's disease]])

**N**on-prancreatic neoplasms - fibrosarcoma, haemangiopericytomas

## Symptoms

Autonomic:
- Sweating
- Anxiety
- Hunger
- Tremor
- Palpitations
- Dizziness

Neuroglycopenic: 
- Confusion
- Drowsiness
- Visual trouble
- Sizures
- Coma
- Mutism
- Personality change
- Restlessness

## Signs

- **Pale Skin:** Skin may appear pale and cool.
- **Rapid Heartbeat:** Increased heart rate is a common sign.
- **Dilated Pupils:** Pupils may dilate in response to low blood sugar.

## Diagnostic Tests

##### Whipple's triad
Symptoms or signs of hypoglycaemia + $\downarrow$ plasma glucose + resolution of symptoms or signs post glucose rise $\rightarrow$ caused by hypoglycaemia

- Document BM during attack and lab glucose if in hospital
- Take drug history and exclude liver failure
- 72h fasting to confirm with close monitoring.
- **Bloods**: glucose, insulin, c-peptide, plasma ketones (if endogenous hyperinsulinism suspected) proinsulin, $\beta$-hydroxybutrate

###### Hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (HH)
- **Causes**: insulinoma, sulfonylureas, insulin injection (no detectable c-peptide - this only released with endogenous insulin)

###### Insulin low or undetectable

- No excess ketones 
	- Non-pancreatic neoplasm; anti-insulin receptor antibodies
- Excess ketones
	- Alcohol, pituitary insufficiency, [[Addison's Disease]]


## Management

- **Oral Glucose:** Consuming a source of glucose, such as fruit juice or candy. If events frequent advise many high starch meals. 
- **Glucagon Injection:** In severe cases, a glucagon injection may be administered.
- **Adjustment of Medications:** Modifying diabetes medications and insulin dosages as needed.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Loss of Consciousness:** Severe hypoglycemia can lead to unconsciousness.
- **Seizures:** In some cases, hypoglycemia may trigger seizures.
- **Impaired Cognitive Function:** Prolonged low blood sugar levels can impair cognitive function.
