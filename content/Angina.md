Pain due to partial blockage of a coronary vessel. Can be stable or unstable

- stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting
- unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting ^1f93a5

Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.

## Causes/Factors

- [[Coronary Artery Disease#Causes Factors|Same as CAD]]

## Symptoms

- **Chest Pain:** Pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning in the chest.
	- Pain subsides in stable angina
- **Pain Radiation:** May spread to the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder, or back.
- **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing, especially during exertion.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired, especially with exertion.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **ECG:** usually normal - _may_ show ST depression or flat or inverted T waves
- **Blood Tests:** FBC, U&Es, TFTs, lipids, HbA1C
- **Echo and CXR** to rule out gross defects and differential diagnoses
- **Angiography** - for typical and atypical angina if the patient _does not_ have a previous episode of proven [[Coronary Artery Disease|Ischemic Heart Disease]] 

## Management

1. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Quitting smoking, adopting a heart-healthy diet, exercising regularly, managing stress.
2. **Medications:** [[Cardiovascular drugs]] - GTN spray or sublingual to relieve acute episodes, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, statins.
3. **Cardiac Rehabilitation:** Supervised exercise and education program.
4. **Interventional Procedures:** Angioplasty with stent placement or coronary artery bypass surgery in severe cases.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Heart Attack:** Angina may progress to a heart attack if blood flow is completely blocked.
- **Unstable Angina:** Severe chest pain at rest, indicating an increased risk of heart attack.
