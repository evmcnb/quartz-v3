Pain due to partial blockage of a coronary vessel. Can be stable or unstable

- stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting
- unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting

Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.
