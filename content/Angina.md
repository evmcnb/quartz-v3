Pain due to partial blockage of a coronary vessel. Can be stable or unstable

- stable angina (more common) – attacks have a trigger (such as stress or exercise) and stop within a few minutes of resting
- unstable angina (more serious) – attacks are more unpredictable (they may not have a trigger) and can continue despite resting

Some people develop unstable angina after having stable angina.

## Causes/Factors

- [[Coronary Artery Disease#Causes Factors]]

## Symptoms

- **Chest Pain:** Pressure, tightness, squeezing, or burning in the chest.
	- Pain subsides in stable angina
- **Pain Radiation:** May spread to the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder, or back.
- **Shortness of Breath:** Difficulty breathing, especially during exertion.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired, especially with exertion.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG):** Records the heart's electrical activity at rest and during exercise.
- **Stress Test:** Measures the heart's response to physical stress.
- **Coronary Angiography:** X-ray imaging of coronary arteries with contrast dye.
- **Blood Tests:** To assess cholesterol levels and cardiac enzymes.


## Management

1. **Lifestyle Modifications:** Quitting smoking, adopting a heart-healthy diet, exercising regularly, managing stress.
2. **Medications:** Nitroglycerin to relieve acute episodes, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, statins.
3. **Cardiac Rehabilitation:** Supervised exercise and education program.
4. **Interventional Procedures:** Angioplasty with stent placement or coronary artery bypass surgery in severe cases.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Heart Attack:** Angina may progress to a heart attack if blood flow is completely blocked.
- **Unstable Angina:** Severe chest pain at rest, indicating an increased risk of heart attack.
