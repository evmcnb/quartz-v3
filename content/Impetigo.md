Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial skin infection primarily affecting children, although it can occur in people of all ages. It is characterized by the development of red sores or blisters, often around the nose and mouth, which can burst and form golden-coloured crusts. Impetigo is typically caused by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Streptococcus pyogenes* bacteria.
 
## Causes/Factors

The primary causes and risk factors for Impetigo include:

- **Bacterial Infection:** Entry of bacteria through cuts, scratches, or insect bites.
- **Close Contact:** Highly contagious and can spread through direct contact.
- **Warm and Humid Environments:** Conditions that favour bacterial growth.
- **Poor Hygiene:** Lack of proper skin hygiene.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of Impetigo can include:

- **Red Sores or Blisters:** Often around the mouth and nose but can occur elsewhere.
- **Golden-Coloured Crusts:** Formed as the blisters burst and ooze.
- **Itching:** The affected area may be itchy.
- **Enlarged Lymph Nodes:** In some cases.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing Impetigo is primarily based on clinical evaluation, but additional tests may include:

- **Culture of Lesion:** To identify the causative bacteria.
- **Blood Tests:** Rarely needed unless systemic symptoms are present.

## Management

Management of Impetigo may include:

1. **Topical Antibiotics:** For localized, mild cases.
2. **Oral Antibiotics:** For more widespread or severe infections.
3. **Warm Compresses:** To gently clean and remove crusts.
4. **Hygiene Practices:** Keeping the affected area clean.
5. **Avoiding Scratching:** To prevent the spread of bacteria.

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Cellulitis:** Spread of the infection into deeper skin layers.
- **Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis:** Rare, but a potential complication.
- **Scarring:** Especially if there's scratching or secondary infection.
