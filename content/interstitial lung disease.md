Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) refers to a group of lung disorders characterized by inflammation and scarring (fibrosis) of the lung parenchyma in a diffuse manner

## Classification

#### Known cause:
- [[Industrial dust diseases]] e.g. asbestosis, berylliosis, silicosis, cotton worker's lung
- Drugs - nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan
- Hypersensitivity reactions - hypersensitivity pneumonitis
- Infections - [[Tuberculosis]], fungal, viral
- [[Gastro-oesophageal reflux]]

#### Associated with systemic disorder:
- [[Sarcoidosis]]
- [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|Rheumatoid arthritis]]
- [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]]
- [[Sj√∂gren's syndrome]]
- [[Ulcerative Colitis]]

#### Idiopathic 
- Idiopathic [[Pulmonary Fibrosis]]
- Cryptogenic organising pneumonia
- Non-specific interstitial pneumonitis 

## Symptoms

- **Shortness of Breath:** Initially with exertion, but it can progress to occur even at rest.
- **Non-productive paroxysmal cough:** Often persistent and unrelenting.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak.
- **Chest Discomfort:** Discomfort or pain in the chest.
- **Unintended Weight Loss:** Due to the increased effort of breathing.

## Signs

- Abnormal CXR
- **Crackles in the Lungs:** Abnormal lung sounds heard with a stethoscope.
- **Clubbing of Fingers and Toes:** Abnormal enlargement of fingertips and toes due to chronic low oxygen levels.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **CXR**

| Upper zones                      | Mid Zone                    | Lower zone                    |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| TB, hypersensitivity pneumonitis | Sarcoidosis, histoplasmosis | Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis |
| Ankylosing spondylitis           |                             | Asbestosis                    |
| Radiotherapy                     |                             |                               |
| Progressive massive fibrosis                                 |                             |                               |
<center>Causes of shadowing on CXR</center>

- **High-Resolution CT Scan (HRCT):** Imaging to visualize lung abnormalities.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Assess lung function and capacity.
- **Bronchoscopy:** A procedure to examine the airways and collect samples for analysis.
- **Biopsy:** Removing a small piece of lung tissue for examination (surgical or transbronchial).

## Management

Treatment of ILD depends on the specific type and severity:

1. **Medications:** Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs to reduce inflammation.
2. **Oxygen Therapy:** To improve oxygen levels in the blood.
3. **Pulmonary Rehabilitation:** Exercise and education programs to improve lung function.
4. **Lung Transplant:** For severe cases when other treatments are ineffective.
