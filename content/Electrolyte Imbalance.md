| Electrolyte | Hypo-                   | Hyper-                       |
| ------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Sodium      | **Range**: <133mmol/L  | >146mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Confusion, seizures, nausea | Agitatied, tachycardic/tachypneaic      |
|             | **Management**: Correct underlying cause, hypertonic saline slowly (to prevent central pontine myelinolysis) | Fluid restrict, with hypotonic saline slowly (to prevent cerebral edema) |
| Potassium   | **Range**: <3.5mmol/L  | >5.5mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Weakness, arrhythmias, muscle cramps | Muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, abdo pain |
|             | **Management**: Oral or IV potassium supplements | Calcium gluconate, insulin and dextrose, kayexalate |
| Calcium     | **Range**: <2.1mmol/L  | >2.6mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Weakness, nausea, muscle cramps, **Trousseau and Chvostek sign** | Weakness, nausea, cramping, constipation |
|             | **Management**: Calcium supplementation, vitamin D, treat underlying causes | Hydration, loop diuretics, bisphosphonates, treat underlying conditions |
| Magnesium   | **Range**: <0.7mmol/L  | >1.1mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Associated with _hypokalemia_ muscle weakness, tremors, **Trousseau and Chvostek sign** | Decreased consciousness, confusion, **absence of reflexes** |
|             | **Management**: Magnesium supplements, identify and treat underlying causes | IV calcium gluconate, diuretics, dialysis in severe cases |
| Chloride    | **Range**: <96mmol/L   | >106mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Lack of symptoms, $\uparrow\uparrow$ confusion and swelling | Same as hypo |
|             | **Management**: Address underlying cause, chloride replacement | Diuretics, fluid restriction, treat underlying conditions |
| Phosphate   | **Range**: <0.8mmol/L  | >1.5mmol/L                  |
|             | **Symptoms**: Weakness, decreased bone density, muscle cramps | Same as hypo |
|             | **Management**: Phosphate supplements, treat underlying causes | Restrict phosphate intake, manage underlying conditions |
| Bicarbonate | **Range**: <22mmol/L | >30mmol/L | 
|             | **Symptoms**: Dyspnea, confusion, weakness | Increased thirst, nausea, abdominal pain |
|             | **Management**: Treat underlying cause, bicarbonate supplementation | Correct acid-base imbalance, manage underlying conditions |
