Bacteriuria - may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. A diagnosis based on symptoms and signs

Lower UTI = Bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis)
Upper UTI = Pyelonephritis (kidney/renal pelvis)

[[Abacterial cystitis]]/urethral syndrome - a diagnosis of exclusion in patients with dysuria and frequency without demonstratable infection

## Causes/Factors

- Women have increased risk
- $\uparrow$ Bacterial inoculation - sexual activity, urinary or faecal incontinence, constipation
- $\uparrow$ Binding of uropathogenic bacteria - spermicide use, $\downarrow$ oestrogen
- $\downarrow$ Urine flow - dehydration, obstructed urinary tract
- $\uparrow$ Bacterial growth - [[Diabetes Mellitus]], immunosuppression, obstruction, stones, catheter, renal tract malformation, [[Pregnancy]]
- Catheter associated

## Symptoms

- Cystitis (UTI that affects bladder) - frequency, dysuria, urgency, suprapubic pain, polyuria, haematuria
- Prostatitis (affects prostate) - pain around: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis bladder, lower back. Fever, malaise, nausea, urinary symptoms, swollen/tender prostate

- Acute pyelonephritis (affects kidney/renal pelvis) - fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral pain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock

## Signs

Do not rely on classical symptoms in a catharised patient

- Fever
- Abdominal or loin tenderness
- Distended bladder

## Diagnostic Tests

- Urine dipstick - use in non-pregnant women. Negative dip reduces probability of UTI to <20%. No diagnostic value in catheterised sample
- Midstream specimen of urine (MSU) culture - use in pregnant women, men, children, and if fail to respond to empirical antibiotics. Catheterized sample only if septic
- Blood tests - if systemically unwell: FBC , U&Es, CRP and culture. Consider fasting glucose
- Imaging - USS and referral to urology for assessment in men with upper UTI; failure to respond to treatment; recurrent UTI; pyelonephritis; unusual organism; persistent haematuria

## Management

Increase fluid intake

In non-pregnant women of $\geq$ 3 (or one severe) symptom of cystitis and no vaginal discharge, treat empirically without further tests. If discharge consider a [[Pelvic inflammatory disease]]

Lower UTI generally **trimethoprim** or **nitrofurantoin**
Upper UTI take a culture and treat initially with broad spectrum in accordance with local guidelines (eg cefuroxime, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin). Avoid nitrofurantoin as doesn't achieve effective concentrations in blood

## Complications/red Flags

**Renal abscesses**

- Perinephric - uncommon normally caused by gram - bacteria
- Intrarenal - can be associated with classic pyelonephritis
