# Diabetes Mellitus

- type 1 diabetes – where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin
  - Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults
- type 2 – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin
  - Maturity onset DM of the young (MODY)

- Gestational diabetes

Secondary

- Pancreatic destruction ([[pancreatitis]], [[Cystic Fibrosis]])
- [[Cushing's Syndrome]]

## Presenting Features

- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Pruritis vulvae and balanitis
  - vaginal candidiasis
- Hunger
- Blurred vision (can be cured)

## Diagnostic Tests

If symptomatic a single abnormal test is enough, if asymptomatic two abnormal tests are required

- Symptoms and random plasma glucose >11 mmol/L
- Fasting plasma glucose >7 mmol/L
- HbA1C - 48 mmol cut off for starting treatment

Weight loss, short history and moderate or large urinary ketones are indication for immediate insulin treatment at **any age**

## Management

T1 - usually basal bolus injections (once or twice daily long acting insulin + premeal quick acting insulin). Need to judge carbohydrate intake and aware of blood glucose lowering in exercise. Possible insulin pump.

T2 - life style modification. metformin + combination with other drug possibly

Hypoglycaemic agents:

- SGLT2i and GLP1-RA reduce cardiovascular risk
- SGLT2i agents improve heart failure, reduce renal decline and reduce admission

## Complications/red Flags

Hypoglycaemia - due to too high insulin -> coma and brain damage, thrombosis, cardiac arrhythmias

**Microvascular**

- Retinopathy - regular eye test
- Neuropathy - regular foot exam / nerve conduction
- Nephropathy - urine test for albumin - [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]

**Macrovascular**

- [[myocardial infarction]]
- [[cerebral infarction]]
- [[peripheral vascular disease]]
