# Grave's Disease


## Brief Overview

Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder and the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In this condition, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, leading to an excessive production of thyroid hormones. The overactive thyroid gland results in hyperthyroidism and a range of symptoms that affect various body systems.
