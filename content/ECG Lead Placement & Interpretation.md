## Lead Placement

| Lead       | Position                                                              | Heart territory |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| V1         | Right 4th intercostal space                                           | Anterioseptal   |
| V2         | Left 4th intercostal space                                            |       Anterioseptal          |

## Interpretation

#### 1. Confirm details
- Patient details
- When was the ECG taken
- Confirm speed and calibration of paper (25mm/s 10mm/mV)
- Any other ECGs to compare to?

#### 2. Interpret the ECG

##### Assess the rhythm and rate

1. Measure the rate and determine if normal, tachycardic  or bradycardic
	- _max sinus rate $\approx$ 220 - age_
	- A rate of 140-150 suggests possibility of atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block
	- 300/number of big squares = heart rate
	- 5 squares = 1 second

2. Determine if rhythm is regular, regularly irregular, or irregularly irregular (R-R interval)

3. Determine if QRS complex is narrow (normal, <120 ms) or wide ($\geq$ 120 ms)
	- Common causes of wide complex: bundle branch block, ventricular origin of rhythm,  pacemaker, (LVH)

4. Evaluate atrial activity
	- Are there P waves - what is their morphology?
		- Sinus P waves should be up in I and down in aVR
	- If there are no P waves are there fibrillation or flutter waves?

5. Identify relationship between atrial & ventricular activity 
	- Normal PR interval: 120-200ms
	- Does the PR interval change?
	- Correspondence between P waves and QRS

##### Assess the QRS axis and morphology

1. Determine QRS axis

| Lead I       | aVF          | Axis                                   | Deviation                     | Etiologies                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\uparrow$   | $\uparrow$   | Between +90$\degree$ and 0$\degree$    | Normal                        |                                                                                                     |
| $\downarrow$ | $\uparrow$   | Between +180$\degree$ and +90$\degree$ | Right axis deviation          | Normal in children & young adults, RVH, COPD, lateral wall MI                                       |
| $\uparrow$   | $\downarrow$ | Between 0$\degree$ and -90$\degree$    | Left axis deviation OR NORMAL | Normal in older obese adults, LVH, elevated diaphragm, inferior wall MI, ectopic ventricular rhythm |
| $\downarrow$ | $\downarrow$ | Between -90$\degree$ and -150$\degree$ | Extreme axis deviation        | RVH, acute right ventricular strain, lateral STEMI, COPD, hyperkalaemia, dextrocardia                                                                                                    |

To determine whether it is true left axis deviation look at lead II and it will be $\downarrow$  

2. Examine QRS morphology
	- Pathologic Q waves - usually due to prior MI
	- RVH and LVH
	- If the QRS is wide identify whether the cause is left or right bundle branch block (**WiLLiaM MaRRoW**) or just delayed
	- Look for low voltage - [[Obesity]], [[COPD]], [[Pleural Effusion]], pericardial effusion, infiltration, [[Hypothyroidism]]
	- Look for electrical alternans which indicates large pericardial effusion
	- Look for delta waves - indicates accessory pathway 

##### Assess ST segments, T waves and QT interval

1. Examine the ST segments
	- 1mm in at least 2 anatomically continuous leads
	- ST elevation: STEMI, LBBB, LVH, early repolarization, pericarditis, vasospasm 
	- ST depression: Ischaemia/infarction, tachycardia, digoxin, hypokalaemia, secondary repolarization abnormality 

2. Examine the T waves
	- Inverted T waves same as ST depression + intracranial haemorrhage, later stage pericarditis and [[Hypothyroidism]]
	- Peaked T waves suggest hyperkalaemia or hyperacute MI

3. Measure QT interval and correct for HR (should be <1/2 RR interval)
	- Prolonged QT: medications, long QT syndrome, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, hypothermia
