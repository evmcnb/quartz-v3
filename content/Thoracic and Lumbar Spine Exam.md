## Introduction

- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)
- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves
- Gain consent to continue
- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing

## Look

- Observe the patient from behind to look for any scoliosis
- Then ask the patient to turn to the side to look for any exaggerated thoracic kyphosis or loss of normal lumbar lordosis.

## Feel

- Palpate the vertebrae and sacroiliac joints for alignment and tenderness
- Then palpate the para-spinal muscles for tenderness or tightness

## Move

- **Lumbar flexion and extension** - place 3 fingers over the lumbar spine and ask the patient to bend forward as much as possible. Fingers should move apart
- **Lumbar lateral flexion** - ask patient to run their hand down the side of their leg 
- **Thoracic rotation** - ask patient to cross their hands and then twist their shoulders side to side
- **Straight leg raise** - ask the patient to go back onto the bed and lie it flat. Then raise one leg at a time - this will exacerbate nerve root irritation and dorsiflexion will further show this (sciatic nerve L3, L4, S1)

## End pieces

- Patella (L3,L4) and ankle jerk reflexes (S1, S2)
- Babinski response for upper motor neurone lesions
- Dorsiflexion of big toe (L5 nerve root)


## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.
