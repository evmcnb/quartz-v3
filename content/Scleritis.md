A severe sight threatening inflammatory conditions characterised by inflammation of the sclera 

Anterior scleritis (90% of cases)
- Diffuse anterior - commonest (50%) and benign form - widespread inflammation of anterior sclera. **Not sight threatening and tends to resolve**
- Nodular - erythematous tender fixed nodules in the sclera. **1 in 4 progress to necrotising scleritis**. Commonly reoccurs 
- Necrotising - less frequent. extreme pain and marked scleral damage. **Usually associated with underlying systemic disease**
	- with corneal inflammation - sclerokeratitis 
	- without inflammation (scleromalacia perforans) - notable for lack of symptoms until the bare choroid is seen under the thin ater of the conjunctiva. Bilateral and only seen in advanced [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|RA]] usually in women 

Posterior scleritis

> [!info] Episcleritis
> Is inflammation of the superficial episcleral later of the eye. It is relatively common benign and self-limiting
> Episcleritis **does not** progress to scleritis

## Causes/Factors

- Autoimmune disorders - a/w RA is most common, [[Systemic Lupus Erythematosus]], [[Inflammatory Arthritis]], granulomatosis with polyangiitis
- Infections
- Trauma 
- Idiopathic sometimes not known

## Symptoms

- Severe eye pain
- Redness
- Photophobia
- Tearing - excessive tearing due to ocular irritation and inflammation 

## Signs

- Scleral thickening - visible on exam
- Scleral injection - diffuse or localised injfection of the scleral vessels with a blueish hue 
- Nodules or plaques on the sclera - chronic inflammation
- Episcleral vascular engorgement 

## Investigations

- Slit-lamp to assess scleral inflammation oedema and associated complications 
- USS - to evaluate scleral and intraocular structures particularly in posterior scleritis 
- Blood tests for autoimmune and inflammatory markers. At least 50% of patients have an underlying autoimmune condition

## Management

**Diffuse anterior scleritis and nodular scleritis** 
- Oral NSAIDs (ibuprofen 400m qds)
- If not effective then oral prednisolone (80mg od) 
- If not effective could try subconjuctival or periorbital steroid injection but controversial 
- If not effective immunosuppressive therapy - methotrexate, azathioprine mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide or ciclosporin may be helpful 

- Diagnostic biopsy can be helpful
- Surgery can be required to address complications

**Necrotising anterior scleritis**
- Systemic steroids and immunosuppresive therapies
- May need surgical intervention if perforation is impending 

**Scleromalacia perforans**
- No specific effective treatment

**Posterior scleritis**
- Younger patients usually respond well to oral NSAIDs but elderly patients as managed as with anterior scleritis
