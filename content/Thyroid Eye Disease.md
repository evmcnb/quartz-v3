---
Autoimmune condition associated with [[Grave's disease]] seen in 25-50% of people with Graves'.

Due to a specific immune response that causes retro-orbital inflammation. Swelling and oedema of the extraocular muscles lead to limitation of movement and to proptosis which is usually bilateral 

## Causes/Factors

- Main known risk factor is smoking 
- Eye disease may not correlate with thyroid disease - patient can be euthyroid, hypothyroid or hyperthyroid. 

## Symptoms

- **Eye Discomfort:** Gritty sensation, redness, and excessive tearing.
- **Swelling:** Swelling of the eyelids and tissues around the eyes.
- **Double Vision:** Impaired eye movement can lead to double vision.
Nerve damage does not go hand in hand with protrusion - if the eye cannot protrude nerve damage is more likely. 
## Signs

- **Eye Bulging:** Protrusion of one or both eyes, often referred to as exophthalmos.
- **Proptosis:** Forward displacement of the eyeball.
- **Eyelid Retraction:** Upper eyelids may appear elevated.
- **Conjunctival Redness:** Redness of the conjunctiva due to inflammation.
- **Papilledema:** increased pressure 
- **Photophobia**: nerve involvement 

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Clinical Examination:** Ophthalmologists assess eye symptoms and perform a thorough eye examination.
- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Assessing thyroid hormone levels to determine if Graves' disease is present.
- **Imaging Studies:** CT or MRI scans may be used to visualize eye and orbital structures.

## Management

- **Control of Thyroid Function:** Managing hyper or hypo thyroidism 
- **Symptomatic Treatment:** Lubricating eye drops, sunglasses, and elevation of the head during sleep (decrease periorbital oedema). to alleviate symptoms.
- **Systemic Steroids:** In severe cases, prednisolone 30-120mg daily usually reduces inflammation


## Complications/red Flags

- **Optic Nerve Compression:** Severe cases may lead to compression of the optic nerve, impacting vision.
- **Corneal Ulcers:** Reduced eyelid closure can lead to corneal exposure and the development of corneal ulcers.
- **Cosmetic Concerns:** Changes in eye appearance can have significant psychosocial effects.
