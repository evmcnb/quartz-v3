Inflammation of the paranasal sinuses. Usually accompanied by inflammation of the nasal cavity - rhinosinusitis 

- Acute < 12 weeks
- Chronic >12 weeks

There are four sets of **_paranasal sinuses_**:

- **_Frontal sinuses_** (above the eyebrows)
- **_Maxillary sinuses_** (either side of the nose below the eyes)
- **_Ethmoid sinuses_** (in the ethmoid bone in the middle of the nasal cavity)
- **_Sphenoid sinuses_** (in the sphenoid bone at the back of the nasal cavity)

## Causes/Factors

- Infection - viral URTI
- Allergies
- Obstruction of drainage - foreign body, trauma, polyps
- Smoking
- Asthma


## Presentation

Someone usually with a recent viral URTI
- Nasal congestion
- Nasal discharge
- Facial pain or headache
- Facial pressure
- Facial swelling over the affected areas
- Loss of smell

## Signs

- Tenderness to palpation of the affected areas
- Inflammation and oedema of the nasal mucosa
- Discharge
- Fever
- Other signs of systemic infection (e.g., tachycardia)

## Investigations

Usually none needed. In patients with persistent symptoms investigations can include
- Nasal endoscopy
- CT scan

> [!warning] Viral vs Bacterial
>Acute bacterial is defined by at least 3 of:
>- Symptoms for more than 10 days
>- Temperature 38$\degree+$ 
>- Discoloured or purulent nasal discharge
>- Severe local pain
> - Marked deterioration after initial milder phase 

## Management

Advise on the natural course and cause of the condition. Simple symptom relieving measures

- Do not recommend antibiotics with symptoms for up to 10 days. Most are viral causes and resolve within 2-3 weeks
- After 10 days have the options of:
	- High dose steroid nasal spray for 14 days (mometasone 200mcg TDS)
	- A delayed antibiotic prescription if not improving 10 days after that

For chronic sinusitis: 
- Saline nasal irrigation 
- Steroid nasal sprays or drops
- Functional endoscopic sinus surgery - obstructions - swollen mucosa, bone, polyps, deviated septum.
