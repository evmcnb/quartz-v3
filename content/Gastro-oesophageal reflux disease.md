Chronic reflux of gastric contents back into the oesophagus resulting gastritis

"Proven GORD" refers to endoscopically determined reflux disease

**Oesophagitis** - when inflammation and mucosal erosions are seen
**Endoscopy** - negative reflux disease (non-erosive reflux disease) symptoms but normal endoscopy

> [!example] Barrett's Oesophagus
> 10-15% of people with GORD will develop Barrett's oesophagus and 1-10% will develop oesophageal adenocarcinoma over next 10-20 years
## Causes/Factors

- Lifestyle factors - obesity, trigger foods, smoking, alcohol, coffee and stress
- Drugs that decrease lower oesophageal sphincter pressure - CCBs, anti-cholinergics, theophylline, benzos and nitrates
- [[Pregnancy]]

## Symptoms

- Heart burn
- Regurgitation - sour or bitter-tasting fluid in mouth
- Dysphagia 
- Chest pain
- NSAIDs

## Signs

- Inflammation and erosion on endoscopy 
- Dental erosion - erosion of dental enamel due to recurrent regurgitation of acidic gastric contents 
- Bloating
- Nocturnal cough

## Investigations

- Endoscopy
- Oesophageal pH monitoring
- Oesophageal manometry - measurement of motility and lower oesophageal sphincter pressure 
- Barium swallow - strictures or hiatal hernias

## Management

- Lifestyle measures - sleeping with head raised
- Stop exacerbating drgs
- Full-dose PPI for 4 weeks for proven GORD - 8 weeks for severe oesophagitis
	- Consider a further 4 weeks if unresolved
	- H2 receptor antagonist reduce gastric acid secretion

## Complications/red Flags

- Ruling out other diagnosis are important - cardiac or hepatobilliary disease can contribute to symptoms
