# Respiratory

---

# [[Asthma]]

- Reversible intermittent narrowing of _conducting airways_

Changes:

- Thicker wall due to inflammation & tissue hyperplasia
- Narrower lumen due to mucus

SOB, wheeze, cough, hyperinflation

---

# [[Bronchitis]]

- Inflammation of the bronchials - chronic form is part of COPD
- Acute form usually caused by virus in children (Haemophilus influenzae in bacterial)

- Mainly inflammation that causes airway narrowing

# [[Emphysema]]

- Damage to alveoli by breaking down walls between them
- Destruction of elastic fibres

---

# [[COPD]]

Combination of **chronic bronchitis** and **emphysema**

- Chemicals and heat trigger inflammation in bronchi and lung parenchyma $\rightarrow$ scarring, mucus hyperplasia, alveolar wall loss (emphysema)
- Mainly in smokers

---

# [[Bronchiectasis]]

Permanent dilation of bronchi and bronchioles due to wall damage secondary to **chronic necrotising infection**

- Usually triggered by obstruction (tumour, thick mucus in CF) and/or infection
- Obstruction causes infection or infection arises $\rightarrow$ inflammation $\rightarrow$ wall damage, dilation and debris and mucus
- Productive cough - possibly blood

---

# Chronic Interstitial Lung Diseases

Mixed group often scarring +/- inflammation in multiple areas in both lungs that reduces compliance (stiff lungs) = _restrictive_

### Idiopathic [[Pulmonary Fibrosis]]

- Progressive patchy scarring especially lower zones that is fatal
- Repeated epithelial injury $\rightarrow$ inflammation and fibrosis
- Dry cough and progressive SOB

---

### Pneumoconiosis

- Lung damage secondary to particle inhalation: **coal dust, silica, asbestos**
- Occupational exposure
- Particles ingested by macrophages, trigger fibrosis - smoking worsens
- Reduced conducting airways due to dust accumulation and fibrosis

---

### [[Sarcoidosis]]

- Multisystem granulomatous disease that most commonly involves lymph nodes and lungs
- 20-60 most common, all ages & genders globally more in smokers and African and North European descent
- Idiopathetic granulomatous inflammation leading to fibrosis (non-caseating granulommas)
- Nodal enlargement, resp symptoms, constitutional symptoms (fever fatigue, weight loss, sweats)

---

### Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis

- Inflammatory and fibrotic bronchiolar response to inhaled antigens that are not removed
- Chronic inflammation around bronchioles sometimes with intersitial fibrosis
- Resp symptoms, constitutional symptoms

---

# [[Cystic Fibrosis]]

- Abnormally thickened mucous due to chloride channel deletion of a phenylalanine residue - all tubes/mucous places have issues
- Dehydrated mucus that blocks lumen $\rightarrow$ infections, inflammation and scarrinng (S. aureus in childhood, Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
- Bronchitis, bronchiectasis, pancreas - exocrine aatrophy and fibrosis, seminiferous tubules blockage 95% males infertile

- Hb Barts (all 4 genes $a^0$) - hydrops fetalis incompatible with life

---

## $\beta$-thalassaemia

- Similar to alpha - microcytic hypochromic RBCs

**Trait** - Hb level normal or only slighly reduced - no clinical probs

**Intermedia** - no absolute requirement for transfusions to survive. Clinical picture v dependant on genetics

**Major** - severe anaemia, lots of abnormal nucleated RBCs clinical features due to severe anaemia. Hair on end skull

Need blood but causes Fe toxicity so iron chelation needed too

---

# Haematological changes in pregnancy

- Plasma volume $\uparrow$ 50%, RBC $\uparrow$ 25%, so dilutation occurs, maximally at 32 weeks.
- Increases folic acid requirements
- Leukocytosis - mainly neutrophilia (left shift may also been seen more immature cells)
- Thrombocytopenia - no pathological significance and recovers
- Pro-thrombotic state however - coagulation factor increase, and clot breakdown decreases

---

# Neonate Haematology

Where is blood made in utero

- Day 18 to 3m in yolk sac
- 3m to 6m liver and spleen
- 6m onward bone marrow

Haemoglobin:
$\alpha^2$ + $\gamma^2$ = Fetal Hb
$\alpha^2$ + $\beta^2$ = Adult Hb
$\alpha^2$ + $\delta^2$ = HbA$_2$

---

**How do RBC differ in neonates**

- Different Hb (Hb-F completely gone by 6 months)
- Polycythaemic
- $\uparrow$ reticulocytes
- $\uparrow$ nucleated RBCs - gone after 3-4 days, if still present after indicates baby struggled in womb/placental hypoxia

---

# Aquired bleeding disorders

## Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation

Excess clotting uses up all clotting factors which leads to excessive bleeding. Microvascular thrombosis $\rightarrow$ tissue ischaemia

Many causes: trauma, fat necrosis, blood incompatability, liver disease, infection, sepsis, cancer

Treat underlying cause and give platelet transfusions

---

## Liver disease

Makes clotting factor components and protein C and S. Damage to the liver can lead to:

- Cirrhotic coagulopathy
- Platelet dysfunction
- Thrombocytopenia

Limited treatment options - platelet tx, FFP/prothrombin complex, cryoprecipitate or fibinogen concentrate

---

## Renal disease

Drugs accumulating in renal failure (penicillins) can bind to platelets and block their receptors.

Anaemia can lead to decreased platelet interaction which then causes more platelet function

- Easy bruising , petechia, gum bleeding, nosebleeds etc
- Patients with uncontrolled high BP and on dialysis increased risk of ICH

Correct anaemia and avoid antiplatelet drugs

---

## Vitamin K deficiency

FII, VII, IX, X deficiency

**LMWH** - mainly inhibits FXa only, less monitoring needed. Sub-cut inj.
**Unfractionated** - continuous infusion, monitor aPTT ratio, uncommon can cause HIT (heparin induced thrombocytopenia)

- Chronic use $\rightarrow$ osteoporosis
- Reverse effects with protamine sulphate

---

## Warfarin

Vitamin K antagonist with lots of interactions with drugs and food. FII, VII, IX, X, protein C +S all vit K dependant.

- Monitor INR $\approx$ PT ratio
- Start on LMWH at same time to prevent warfarin induced skin necrosis
- Antidote: prothrombin complex concentrate - raises inhibitor factors + vit K

---

## Direct oral anticoagulants

Predictable dose response and minimal interactions unlike warfarin. Fast onset and offset. **Cannot use with mechanical heart valves**

**Factor X inhibitors** - -xaban eg rivaroxaban
**Direct thrombin inhibitors** - dabigatran

---

# Anti-platelets

- clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel

---

# Haematological emergencies

## Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura

Type of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, antibodies against ADAMTS13 enzyme. So vWF cannot be broken down leading to many clots

- aquired
- fragments of vWF slice up RBCs and vessels
- treat with plasma exchange to remove antibody and prevent thrombosis with aspirin and LMWH

---

# Anaemia

---

Haematinic deficiencies -
Iron

- Due to blood loss, inceased demand, diet. preganancy

- Blood film, antibodieis, B12, folate, GI investigations

---

Other causes:

- Alcohol, drugs, toxins
- Renal impairment (EPO production)
- Primary haematological - malignancies, Hb disorders, aplasia,
- Secondary to chronic disase
  - Normocytic
  - Malignant/inflammation/infection
  - Hepcidin - released by macrophages

# Calcium biochemistry

![width:600px|575](calcium%20diagram.png)

- Calcium values dependant on albumin (protein bound component)
- If albumin low cannot use adjusted calcium so use ionised calcium instead

---

# Phosphate biochemistry

- ATP, DNA backbone, membrane phospholipids

### Homeostasis of calcium and phosphate

- PTH and vitamin D and metabolites controlling factors

Balance of - GI absorption, bone storage/resorption, renal excretion/reabsorption

---

# PTH

Net effect:

- **Increase serum calcium**
- **Decrease serum phosphate**

PTH causes osetoclasts to breakdown bone releasing Ca and PO4
$\hookrightarrow$ kidneys increase reabsorption of Ca but increase PO4 excretion

Kidneys also increase active form of vitamin D to absorb more from gut

**Chronic** - autoimmune (anti-parietal/intrinsic factor), H. pylori, chemical

###### Helicobacter pylori

- Gram -ve spiral bacterium
- Damages epithelium usually in antrum rather than body
- Glandular atrophy and intestinal metaplasia

---

# Peptic ulcer disease

Localised defect extending at least into submucosa

- First part of duodenum, junction of antral/body mucosa, distal oesophagus most common sites
- Caused by - hyperacidity, H. pylori, NSAIDs/smoking

Complications

- Haemorrhage - acute and/or chronic anaemia
- Perforation - peritonitis/ penetration into adjacent organ (liver,..)
- Stricturing - hour-glass deformity
- ***

# Gastric Cancer

Most commonly adenocarcinoma, less freq endocrine tumours, lymphomas, stromal tumours. TNM staging

Adenocarcinoma of GOJ associated with reflux, but of body/antrum not a/w.

Factors: diet, H. pylori, bile reflux, hypochlorhydria

**Intestinal type** - well or moderately differentiated
**Diffuse type** - poorly differentiated, scattered growth, cadherin loss

---

# [[Coeliac Disease]]

Immune mediated enteropathy when ingestation of wheat, rye or barley - anything containing **gliadin**

- Increased CD8+ intraepithelial lymphocytes
- Villous atrophy, crypt elongation

Non-invasive serologic tests usually performed before biopsy - IgA to TTG or IgA/G to gliadin. Tissue biopsy gold standard

Treatment with gluten free diet

---

# Benign Liver tumours

**Hepatocyte adenoma** - may be multiple, often driven by exogenous steroids, can be fatal if rupture

**Bile duct adenoma** - lots of tiny white nodules

**Haemangioma** - often incidental finding on liver imaging

**Focal nodular hyperplasia** - youg females, regenerative arterialised nodule - removed as hard to tell if always benign

---

# Malignant Liver tumours

**Hepatocellular carcinoma** - usually in cirrhosis (Hep C/B), alpha fetoprotein (AFP) as tumour marker

**Cholangiocarcinoma** - bile duct cell malignancy due to chronic inflammation, aggressive difficult to resect

**Angiosarcoma** - aggressive tumour of blood vessels, a/w toxins _vinyl chloride_, _thorotrast_

---

# Secondary Liver tumours

Majority of liver tumours as secondary. Most commonly from: lung, breast, colon, pancreas.

- Multiple whitish nodules
- May replace large volumes of liver before function is compromised

---

# Gallstones

Cholesterol, bile salts, bacterial growth & calcification can slowly form a stone (calculus). Middle-aged, overweight female $\uparrow$ risk

**Complications** - perforation, chronic cholecystitis, jaundice, pancreatitis

# Chronic [[cholecystitis]]

- due to chemical/bacteria
- over time fibrosis + ulceration

- RUQ pain, fever, jaundice
- Tx - cholecystectomy


---

# [[inflammatory bowel disease]]

Common features:

- diarrhoea
- rectal bleeding
- abdominal pain
- anorexia
- weight loss
- anaemia
- toxic megacolon and perforation
- stricture (common in Crohn's)
- Anti-TNFa potential treatment option
- EIMs: pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum, uveitis, amyloidosis, polyarthritis

# Ischaemic bowel disease

- Transient - 80%
- Acute fulminant & gangrenous
- Chronic segmental ulcerating (ischaemic stricture)

Occlusive - arterial embolism
Non-occlusive - arterial thrombus

Commonest site is left colon - rectum to splenic flexure

Acute onset cramping abdo pains, urge to defaecate, bloody diarrhoea, usually improve within 48hr otherwise surgery

---

# Diverticular disease

High intralumen pressure (due to lack of fibre) cause protrusions of mucosa and submucosa through the bowel wall - commonly sigmoid colon. Common in developed world

- Asymptomatic 90-99%
- Cramping abdominal pain

Acute complications

- Abscess
- Perforation + haemorrhage


Chronic Complications

- intestinal obstruction-
- fistula

---

# Colorectal polyps

Kinda opposite to diverticulitis - mucosal protrusion into lumen. Solitary or multiple, pedunculated, sessile or flat, small or large, due to pathology deeper in bowel wall

- Neoplastic, hyperplastic, hamartomatous (Peutz-Jeghers), inflammatory or reactive
- Adenoma most common if neoplastic - 5% progress to cancer
  - Present in 25-35% of population >50 y/o

---

# Colorectal cancer

3rd most common cancer (behind lung, breast/prostate) - TNM

- FAP 1% - APC TSG mutation
- Lynch syndrome 3% (MLH1 DNA repair gene)
- Other 20%

Protective - fibre/folate, aspirin (NSAIDs), oral contraceptives
Bad - fat/red meat, obesity, alcohol, either IBD

Most common moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma (mucious in 10-20%) in rectum. Mets to lymph, lung, liver, peritoneal

---

# [[Jaundice]]

Bilirubin produced in spleen is unconjugated (insoluble). Needs to be processed by liver to make it soluble. If this doesn't happen unconjugated bilirubin builds up causes jaundice

Pre-hepatic - too much bilirubin produced: haemolytic anaemia

Hepatic - too few function cells: Acute/chronic liver disease, IEoM

Post-hepatic - bile duct obstruction

Blood tests: LFTs (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, albumin)

---

# [[Hepatitis]]

## Acute

Inflammation, virus, drugs, autoimmune, toxin/metabolic

Extent depends on how many hepatocytes are damaged at once + how good liver is at regenerating

Symptoms: asymptomatic, malaise, jaundice, encephalopathy

---

## Chronic

Caused by something that doesn't go away - often a/w fibrosis, balance of damage and attempts at repair

- Immunological - virus, autoimmune, drugs
- Toxic/metabolic - fatty liver disease, A/NAFLD
- Genetic inborn errors - iron, copper, alpha 1 antitrypsin
- Biliary disease - autoimmune, obstruction, drugs
- Vascular disease - clotting disorders, drugs

---

### Viral

- Hepatitis viruses
- EBV
- CMV
- HSV

### Alcohol

- Fatty change (steatosis) - may be due to alcohol AFLD
- Cirrhosis

Significant driver of mortality from liver disease

---

### [[Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease]]

Now the most common cause of liver disease

- Same pathological spectrum as alcohol type
- a/w _"Metabolic syndrome"_ - obesity, T2DM, hyperlipidaemia
- Tx address cause of metabolic syndrome

### Hepato-toxic drugs

- Iatrogenic - rare but still commonest cause of acute liver failure
- Self-administered - paracetamol overdose (glutathione depletion)

---

Any drug can cause liver injury. But the same drug can cause different injury in different patients. Usually acute

**Intrinsic** - every time, predictable eg paracetamol
**Idiosyncratic** - rare, unpredictable eg metabolic or immunological

### Inherited - Haemochromatosis

Inborn error of iron metabolism causing accumulation in:

<div class="twocols">

- Liver $\rightarrow$ cirrhosis
- Pancreas $\rightarrow$ diabetes
- Skin $\rightarrow$ pigmentation
- Joints $\rightarrow$ arthritis
- Heart $\rightarrow$ cardiomyopathy
- Treat with removal of blood to return iron to normal

</div>

---

### Inherited - Wilson's disease

Inborn error of copper metabolism that usually presents at a younger age. Copper accumulates in:

- Liver $\rightarrow$ cirrhosis
- Eyes $\rightarrow$ Kayser-Fleischer rings
- Brain $\rightarrow$ ataxia etc

Check serum copper & caeruloplasmin, uninary copper, slit lamp and liver biopsy
Treat with copper chelation and excretion enhancement (penicillamine)

---

### Inherited - Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency

Abnormal anti-protease which cannot be exported from hepatocyte

- Accumulates in liver cells and damages them - cirrhosis
- Insufficient in blood, failure to inactivate neutrophil digestive enzymes $\rightarrow$ emphysema

---

### Autoimmune liver disease

- F > M with autoantibodies and plasma cells interfacing
- Can cause acute liver failure (transplant) or chronic disease (cirrhosis)
- Treatment by immune suppression

**Primary biliary cholangitis** - anti-mitochondrial antibodies, $\uparrow$ ALP, bile duct granulomas at early stage then duct loss and cirrhosis

**Primary sclerosing cholangitis** - associated with UC, $\uparrow$ ALP, onion skin fibrosis then ductopenia and cirrhosis

---

# Hepatic failure

Acute - rare severe rapid liver injury

Chronic - end stage chronic liver disease

- Ascites
- Muscle wasting
- Bruising
- Gynaecomastia
- Spider naevia
- Varices, caput medusae (variceal umbilical vein collaterals)

---

# Liver function tests

| Test                                | Description                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Alanine transaminase (ALT)          | An enzyme that is found in the liver. It is released into the bloodstream when the liver is damaged.                                                     |
| Aspartate transaminase (AST)        | An enzyme that is found in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is released into the bloodstream when any of these organs are damaged.                      |
| Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)          | An enzyme that is found in the liver, bones, and intestines. Released when damage/ pressure on cells lining billary ducts.                               |
| Bilirubin                           | A yellow pigment that is produced when the body breaks down red blood cells. Excretion function test of the liver                                        |
| Albumin                             | A protein that is produced by the liver. It helps to maintain the fluid balance in the body. Synthetic function test                                     |
| Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) | An enzyme that is found in the liver, bile ducts, and kidneys. Elevated due to structural damage in these organs - liver specific if also $\uparrow$ ALP |

---

# [[Pancreatitis]]

Acute - gland reverts to normal if underlying cause removed
Chronic - irreversible loss of tissue

### Acute

- Relatively common - damage to exocrine parenchyma
- Gallstones (50%), alcohol (25%), idopathic (10%)
- Hereditary pancreatitis - recurrent attacks of severe pancratitis PRSS1 a. dominant or SPINK1 a. recessive

---

- Emergency, severe acute abdo pain with raised serum amaylase/lipase. Persistent hypocalcaemia poor prognnostic sign
- Mild - swollen gland with fat necrosis
- Severe - swollen, necrotic gland and haemorrhage (Grey Turner's and Cullen's sign)
- Pseudocysts (full of pancreatic juice)

---

# Chronic pancreatitis

- Irreversible destruction of exocrine tissue (replaced with fibrosis that can mimic carcinoma) followed by destruction of endocrine -
- Malnutrition and diabetes, pain
- Recurrent acute can become chronic
  **T**oxic - alcohol, drugs, infections
  **I**diopathic
  **G**enetic CFTR, PRSS1, SPINK1
  **A**utoimmune
  **R**ecurrent acute
  **O**bstruction of main duct - stone, cancer, scarring

---

# Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma

- Most common pancreatic cancer - usually in head of pancreas
- $\uparrow$ risk with chronic pancreatitis, DM, alcohol
- Hereditary with Lynch syndrome, FAMMM (p16), Her-2, BRCA1/2, Von Hippel-Lindau, SPINK1, Peutz-Jeghers

---

# Pancreatic carcinoma

- Almost universially fatal
- Cancers in head can invade common bile duct and pancreatic duct $\rightarrow$ + surrounding structures
- Cancers in the body or tail invade stomach, left colon, spleen and left adrenal

---

# Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumours

- Uncommon
- Derived from islet cells - so symptoms depend of endocrine effects
- Spectrum from benign to malignant - normal rules don't apply, difficult to predict progression
- Most common insulinoma

---

# Metabolic changes following trauma

1. Shock - blood loss, poor blood flow, low oxygen supply - catecholamines

2. Hypercatabolism - increased basal metabolic rate, anaerobic metabolism, excessive breakdown of fat and protein - $\uparrow$ cortisol, glucagon $\downarrow$ GH, insulin

3. Anabolic phase - macromolecule synthesis, onset of recovery, improved appetite - risk of refeeding syndrome

---

# Foodbourne GI infections

Ingestion of toxins from pathogen - rapid onset of womiting nausea, diarrhoea, etc. Non-communicable. From improper food handling

Ingestion of pathogen - slower incubation peroid similar symptoms. Can be transferred via faecal-oral route
