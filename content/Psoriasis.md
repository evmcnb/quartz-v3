## Causes/Factors

- **Genetic Predisposition:** Family history plays a significant role.
- **Immune System Dysfunction:** T cells mistakenly attack healthy skin cells.
- **Triggers:** Stress, infections, medications, and injuries can exacerbate symptoms.

## Clinical picture

- **Red, Raised Patches:** Skin lesions are typically red, raised, and covered with silvery scales. salmon red + silvery scales = psoriasis. 
- **Itching and Discomfort:** Itching and pain may accompany the patches, causing discomfort.
- **Nail Changes:** Psoriasis can affect the nails, causing pitting, discoloration, and separation from the nail bed.
- **Joint Pain:** In some cases, psoriatic arthritis may develop, leading to joint pain and swelling.

## Diagnostic Tests

Based off clinical findings. Features of psoriasis include:
- Distribution - on extensor surfaces, trunk, flexures sacral and nasal cleft, scalp and behind the ears 
- Clear delineation between normal and affected skin
- Pin/red skin with silverly scale
- Involvement in other areas such as joints and nails

## Management

- **Topical treatments** - such as emolients, corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, coal tar, and short-contact dithranol (for large plaque)
- Management of psychological factors which could be triggering the flareup 
- Lifestyle advice such as weight loss, smoking cessation and alcohol reduction

## Complications/red Flags

- **Cardiovascular Risks:** Patients with psoriasis may have an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases.
- **Psychosocial Impact:** Addressing the emotional and psychological impact of visible skin lesions is essential for comprehensive care.
