When the lack of insulin or insulin sensitivity causes a starvation state in the body despite excessive glucose. - the ketoacidosis pathway. 

The combination of both acidosis and hyperglycaemia can be deadly

Typically in [[Diabetes Mellitus#Type 1|Type 1 DM]] very rarely in type 2  
## Causes/Factors

- **Insulin Deficiency:** Often due to missed insulin doses or inadequate insulin therapy.
- **Infection or Illness:** Infections or other illnesses can increase the body's need for insulin.
- **Undiagnosed Diabetes:** In some cases, DKA may be the first sign of diabetes.
- **Stress or Trauma:** Physical or emotional stress can contribute e.g.
	- Infection
	- Surgery
	- MI
	- Pancreatitis
- **Certain Medications:** Such as corticosteroids, wrong insulin dose, antipsychotics 

## Symptoms

- Gradual drowsiness
- Polyuria
- Polydipsia 
- Nausea and Vomiting
- Abdominal Pain:
- Fruity Breath Odor: Due to the presence of ketones.
- Confusion or Altered Mental Status

## Diagnostic Tests

1. Acidaemia (venous pH <7.3 or HCO3 < 15mmol/L)
2. Hyperglycaemia (> 11mmol/L or known to have [[Diabetes Mellitus]])
3. Ketonaemia (> 3mmol/L or ++ on dipstick) 

## Management

## Complications/red Flags

> [!Danger] Red flags - get senior help!
> If one or more of the following features is present on admission consider transfer to ICU/HDU for monitoring and central venous access 
>
> - Blood ketones > 6mmol/L 
> - Venous HCO3 < 5mmol/L
> - Potassium < 3.5mmol/L
> - GCS <12
> - SpO2 <92% on air (assuming no respiratory disease)
> - Systolic <90
> - Pulse >100 or <60
> - Anion gap above 16

#### Complications

- Cerebral oedema - watch for fall in GCS
- Aspiration pneumonia 
- Hypo -kalacemia, -magnesaemia and -phosphataemia

- Plasma glucose is usually high but not always especially if insulin continued
- High WCC may be present without an infection 
- Often no fever with an infection
- Some creatinine assays cross-react with ketones so may not get a true renal picture
- Serum amylase is often raise and non-specific abdo pain is common even without a pancreatitis
