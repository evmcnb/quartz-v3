Urticaria, commonly known as hives, is a skin condition characterized by the sudden and transient appearance of red, raised, and intensely itchy welts or wheals on the skin. These welts can vary in size and shape and typically resolve within minutes to hours, often leaving no trace. Urticaria is a common skin manifestation resulting from a complex interplay of immune and inflammatory processes.

## Causes/Factors

The diverse causes and risk factors for Urticaria include:

**Allergic Reactions:**
    - **Foods:** Common allergens like nuts, shellfish, and eggs.
    - **Medications:** Antibiotics, NSAIDs, and certain blood pressure medications.
    - **Insect Stings or Bites:** Bee stings or mosquito bites.
    
**Infections:**
    - **Viral or Bacterial:** Infections such as the common cold or urinary tract infections.
    
**Physical Stimuli:**
    - **Heat or Cold:** Exposure to extreme temperatures.
    - **Pressure:** Pressure on the skin, as seen in dermatographism.
    - **Sunlight:** Sun exposure, known as solar urticaria.
    
**Autoimmune Reactions:**
    - **Autoimmune Urticaria:** The immune system attacks the skin.
    
**Stress:**
    - **Emotional Stress:** Anxiety or stress-induced hives.
    
**Underlying Medical Conditions:**
    - **Thyroid Disorders:** Especially autoimmune thyroid diseases.
    - **Lupus and Other Autoimmune Diseases.**

## Symptoms

Characteristics of Urticaria symptoms include:

- **Red or Pink Welts:** Wheals that are elevated and surrounded by an area of redness.
- **Itching:** Intense itching is a hallmark of urticaria.
- **Swelling:** Angioedema, swelling beneath the skin's surface, may occur.
- **Burning or Sting Sensation:** Some individuals may experience pain or a burning sensation.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing Urticaria involves a combination of clinical evaluation and, if necessary, specific tests:

- **Allergy Testing:** To identify specific allergens triggering an allergic response.
- **Blood Tests:** To check for elevated levels of igE antibodies.

## Management

Comprehensive management of Urticaria includes:

1. **Antihistamines (First-Line Treatment):** Provides relief and blocks the effects of histamine.
2. **Avoidance of Triggers:** Identifying and avoiding triggers when possible.
3. **Cool Compresses:** Applying cool compresses to alleviate itching feeling.
4. **Corticosteroids:** Short courses for rapid control of symptoms.
5. **Epinephrine:** if present due to anaphylaxis

## Complications/Red Flags

Potential complications and red flags include:

- **Angioedema:** Swelling, particularly of the face, lips, or eyes.
- **Anaphylaxis:** Rare but potentially life-threatening; requires immediate medical attention.
- **Chronic Urticaria:** Lasting for more than six weeks, necessitating further investigation.
