### Coal worker's pneumoconiosis

A common dust disease in countries that have/had sub-terrain coal mines
- Inhalation of coal particles over 15-20 years. These are ingested by macophages which die releasing their enzymes causing fibrosis
- Coexisting chronic [[bronchitis]] is common.
- CXR - many round opacities (1-10mm) especially in upper zone 
- Treat bronchitis
### Progressive massive fibrosis

- Due to progression of CWP
- Fibrosis, dyspnoea and eventually [[cor pulmonale]]
- CXR - typically bilateral fibrotic masses (1-10cm) that develop from periphery towards hilum

### Silicosis 

Inhalation of silica particles which are very fibrinogenic
- Metal mining, stone quarrying, sandblasting, pottery and ceramic manufacture
- Progressive dyspnoea, $\uparrow$ incidence of [[Tuberculosis|TB]] 
- CXR diffuse miliary or nodular pattern in upper/mid-zones with _egg shell_ calcification of hilar nodes

### Asbestosis

Inhalation of asbestos fibres. It was used for fire proofing, pipe lagging, electrical wire insulation and roof felt
- Similar to other fibrotic lung diseases
- Also causes pleural plaques and increases risk of bronchial adenocarcinoma and [[pleural mesothelioma]]
