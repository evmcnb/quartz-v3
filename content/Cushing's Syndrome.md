When too much cortisol is present. 

#### Cushing's Disease

Pituitary adenoma releasing ACTH $\rightarrow \uparrow$ cortisol release

#### Cushing's Syndrome

- Any other cause - steroids, adrenal cortex tumour, ectopic tumour eg small cell lung carcinoma


## Causes/Factors

- Pituitary adenoma
- Adrenal tumour
- Ectopic ACTH syndrome - tumours outside the pituitary or adrenals can produce ACTH leading to excessive cortisol
- Prolonged steroid use - prednisone, hydrocortisone

## Symptoms

- Weight gain (abdo and face)
- High blood pressure
- Skin changes - fragile with stretch marks

- [[osteoporosis]]
- Menstrual irregularities

## Diagnostic Tests

- Dexamethasone suppression test - synthetic cortisol should suppress cortisol levels 
- 24hr urine cortisol test - measures cortisol levels
- Late-night salivary cortisol test


## Management

- Surgical removal of tumours
- Medication adjustment - if Cushings via chronic steroid use
- Lifestyle management - weight, BP and glucose

## Complications/red Flags

- [[osteoporosis]]
- Suppressed immune function $\rightarrow$ increased infection risk
- Cardiovascular complications - due to the high blood pressure
