- 24hr urine cortisol test - measures cortisol levels
- Late-night salivary cortisol test


## Management

- Surgical removal of tumours
- Medication adjustment - if Cushings via chronic steroid use
- Lifestyle management - weight, BP and glucose

## Complications/red Flags

- Osteoporosis
- Suppressed immune function $\rightarrow$ increased infection risk
- Cardiovascular complications - due to the high blood pressure
