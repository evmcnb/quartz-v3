- Characterised by _episodes_ of dyspnoea, cough, wheeze
- Reversible airway obstruction and bronchospasm
- Inflammatory disorder reduces air flow rate

## Causes/Factors

Exact cause of asthma still unknown but autoimmune/mast cell basophil degranulation

- Triggers: cold air, exercise, emotion, allergens, infection, smoking, pollution, NSAIDs/$\beta$ blockers (for some)
- Worse in the morning - this can be severe enough to tip the balance into an attack
- Acid reflux - 40-60% of those with asthma have [[acid reflux]]
- Other autoimmuney diseases - [[exzema]], [[hay fever]], allergies/family history
- Work/job related - gets worse on weekdays and better on weekends/holidays

## Symptoms

- Nocturnal cough
- Wheeze
- Worsening of eczema

## Signs

- Tachypnoea
- Hyperinflated chest
- Hyper-resonant percussion
- decreased air entry
- accessory muscle use

## Diagnostic Tests

- Sputum culture
- ABG: $\downarrow PaO_2$ but also $\downarrow PaCO_2$ (hyperventilation)- \*\*if $\uparrow PaCO_2$ failing respiratory
- Spirometry: decreased $FEV_1/FVC$ ratio
- Peak flow - less than predicated or best
	- Moderate - 50-75%
	- Acute severe - 33-50%
	- Life-threatening - <33%

## Management

- Lifestyle/environment changes
- SABA/LABA
- Corticosteroids - prednisolone 40mg od for exacerbation  

- Magnesium sulphate
- Aminophylline
- Anti-IgE antibody (v rarely)

## Complications/red Flags

- **_Silent Chest_**
- Confusion
- Bradycardia

### DDX

- [[pulmonary oedema]], [[COPD]], airway obstruction, [[pneumothorax]], [[pulmonary embolism]], [[bronchiectasis]]
