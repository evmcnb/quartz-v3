Sjögren's Syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation and dysfunction of the exocrine glands, primarily the salivary and lacrimal glands. This results in symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, but it can also affect various other organs and systems in the body. Sjögren's Syndrome is often associated with other autoimmune conditions.

## Causes/Factors

The exact cause of Sjögren's Syndrome is not well understood, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Autoimmune diseases like Sjögren's occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues.

## Symptoms

Common symptoms of Sjögren's Syndrome include:

- **Dry Eyes:** Gritty or burning sensation, light sensitivity, and blurred vision.
- **Dry Mouth:** Difficulty swallowing, speaking, and an increased risk of dental problems.
- **Fatigue:** Profound tiredness and weakness.
- **Joint Pain and Swelling:** Similar to symptoms of arthritis.
- **Dry Skin and Vaginal Dryness:** Affecting the skin and mucous membranes.
- **Salivary Gland Enlargement:** Swelling of the salivary glands.
- **Frequent Infections:** Due to reduced saliva's antimicrobial properties.

## Signs

- **Oral Examination:** Dry, cracked lips, and a dry tongue.
- **Eye Examination:** Ocular surface inflammation and damage.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing Sjögren's Syndrome may involve several tests:

- **Schirmer's Test:** Measures tear production to assess dry eyes.
- **Salivary Flow Rate:** Measures saliva production to assess dry mouth.
- **Blood Tests:** To check for specific antibodies associated with Sjögren's, such as anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibodies.
- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a minor salivary gland to confirm autoimmune changes.

## Management

Treatment of Sjögren's Syndrome aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications:

1. **Symptom Management:** Artificial tears and saliva substitutes to manage dry eyes and dry mouth.
2. **Medications:** Anti-inflammatory drugs, immunosuppressants, and medications to stimulate saliva production.
3. **Dental Care:** Regular dental check-ups to prevent dental problems.
4. **Pain Management:** For joint pain and fatigue.
5. **Management of Complications:** Treatment of complications affecting other organs.

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Increased Infection Risk:** Due to reduced saliva's protective properties.
- **Dental Problems:** Increased risk of tooth decay and gum disease.
- **Organ Involvement:** Sjögren's can affect other organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system.
