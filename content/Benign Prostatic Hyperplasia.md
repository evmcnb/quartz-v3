## Symptoms

- **Urinary Frequency:** Need to urinate more often than usual.
- **Urgency:** Sudden and strong urge to urinate.
- **Nocturia:** Need to wake up during the night to urinate.
- **Weak Urine Stream:** Reduced force and caliber of the urine stream.
- **Difficulty Starting and Stopping:** Trouble initiating and ending urination.
- **Incomplete Emptying:** Feeling that the bladder isn't fully emptied after urination.
## Signs

- **Enlarged Prostate:** Detected during a digital rectal exam.
- **Urinary Symptoms:** As described above.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Digital Rectal Exam (DRE):** Examination of the prostate through the rectum to assess its size and texture.
- **Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test:** Usually normal in BPH, may be raised in prostate cancer
- **Urinalysis:** To rule out urinary tract infections or other conditions.

## Management

1. **Watchful Waiting:** For mild symptoms, regular monitoring without immediate treatment.

2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Reducing caffeine and alcohol intake, limiting fluids before bedtime.

3. **Medications:** Tamsulosin - alpha-blocker to relax prostate muscles, finasteride - 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to reduce DHT levels. Finasteride is indicated when there is a significantly enlarged prostate.

4. **Minimally Invasive Procedures:** Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), laser therapy, prostate stents.

5. **Surgery:** In severe cases, surgical removal of the enlarged part of the prostate.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Urinary Retention:** Inability to urinate due to severe prostate enlargement.
- **Urinary Tract Infections:** Stagnant urine in the bladder can lead to infections.
