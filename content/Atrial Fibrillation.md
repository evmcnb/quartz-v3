A rapid irregular atrial rhythm at 300-600 bpm. The AV node blocks most of these impulses and only responds intermittently (hence irregular QRS). Cardiac output is reduced by 10-20% as ventricles are not primed properly by atria

Main risk is from clots forming from pooling blood in atria leading to ischaemic [[Stroke]]

## Causes/Factors

- Hypertension
- [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
- Excessive alcohol consumption
- [[Hyperthyroidism]]
- [[Heart Failure]]
- [[pneumonia]]

## Symptoms

- Chest pain
- Palpitations
- Dyspnoea
- Syncope/pre-syncope
- May be asymptomatic

## Signs

- Irregularly irregular pulse
- 1st heart sound is of variable intensity
- Signs of underlying cause

## Diagnostic Tests

- ECG
  ![|575](z_attachments/575-2.png)
- Blood: Thyroid function test
- Echo: look at mitral valve and LV function

## Management

- Correct electrolyte balance

Rate control - slows down the heart rate to prevent symptom of palpitations and improve heart beat efficiency

- $\beta$ blocker
- Calcium channel blockers

Rhythm control - convert the hearth rhythm back into sinus rhythm

- Amiodarone
- Digoxin
- Electric (DC) cardioversion

  _No real difference in prognosis between rate or rhythm control_
