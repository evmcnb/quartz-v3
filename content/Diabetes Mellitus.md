- type 1 diabetes – where the body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin ^7f5ee9
  - Latent autoimmune diabetes in adults
- type 2 – where the body does not produce enough insulin, or the body's cells do not react to insulin
  - Maturity onset DM of the young (MODY) - monogenic forms of diabetes that are characterized by early-onset diabetes. **Autosomal dominant**

|              | Type I                                                                                             | Type II                                                                               |

| Aetiology    | Autoimmune ($\beta$-cell destruction)                                                              | Cells become insulin resistance and $\beta$-cell dysfunction                          |
| Presentation | Young (12 y/o peak) slim, osmotic symptoms, weight loss (days to weeks), [[Diabetic ketoacidosis]] | Older (60 y/o) osmotic symptoms, diabetic complications (months-years), usually obese |
| Treatment    | Insulin (match size of meals)                                                                      | Diet, exercise, oral hypoglycemics, insulin later                                                                                      |

- Gestational diabetes

Secondary

- Pancreatic destruction ([[pancreatitis]], [[Cystic Fibrosis]])
- [[Cushing's Syndrome]]

## Presenting Features

- Polyuria
- Polydipsia
- Weight loss
- Fatigue
- Pruritis vulvae and balanitis
  - vaginal candidiasis
- Hunger
- Blurred vision (can be cured)

## Diagnostic Tests

If symptomatic a single abnormal test is enough, if asymptomatic two abnormal tests are required

- Symptoms and random plasma glucose >11 mmol/L
- Fasting plasma glucose >7 mmol/L
- HbA1C - 48 mmol cut off for starting treatment

Weight loss, short history and moderate or large urinary ketones are indication for immediate insulin treatment at **any age**

## Management

#### Type 1
Usually basal bolus injections (once or twice daily long acting insulin + premeal quick acting insulin). Need to judge carbohydrate intake and aware of blood glucose lowering in exercise. Possible insulin pump.

#### Type 2
life style modification. metformin + combination with other drug possibly

Hypoglycaemic agents:

- **Metformin**: A biguanide - $\uparrow$ insulin sensitivity + helps weight. Avoid if eGFR is <36
- **DPP4 inhibitors/gliptins** - block enzyme which destroys the hormone incretin (stimulates a decrease in blood glucose levels) _eg sitagliptin_
- **Glitazone** - $\uparrow$ insulin sensitivity, LFTs needed every 8 weeks - **do not use in patient with [[Heart Failure]]** _eg pioglitazone_
- **Sulfonyurea** - $\uparrow$ insulin secretion
- **SGLT2i** - blocks the reabsorption of glucose in kidneys - wee out sugar. Reduces cardiovascular risk _eg glifazon_


## Complications/red Flags

Hypoglycaemia - due to too high insulin -> coma and brain damage, thrombosis, cardiac arrhythmias

**Microvascular**

- Retinopathy - regular eye test
- Neuropathy - regular foot exam / nerve conduction
- Nephropathy - urine test for albumin - [[Chronic Kidney Disease]]

**Macrovascular**

- [[myocardial infarction]]
- [[Stroke]]
- [[peripheral vascular disease]]
