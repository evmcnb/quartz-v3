Beware deteriorating consciousness after any head injury that initially produced no LOC or after initial drowsiness seems to have resolved. This lucid interval pattern is typical of extradural bleeds

## Causes/Factors

Any tear in dural venous sinus will result in extradural bleed
- Suspect after any traumatic skull fracture - often fractured temporal or parietal bone causing lacerating to middle meningeal artery (pterion)

## Symptoms

- **Loss of Consciousness:** Often followed by a period of lucidity (a brief return to consciousness) before deteriorating.
- **Severe Headache:** Often localized at the site of impact.
- **Nausea and Vomiting:** Resulting from increased intracranial pressure.
- **Confusion:** Altered mental state and disorientation.
- **Weakness or Paralysis:** Typically on one side of the body.
- **Unequal Pupils:** Anisocoria, due to pressure on the brain.

## Signs

- **Lucid Interval:** A period of consciousness between the head injury and the onset of symptoms. This may last hours to days before a bleed declares itself by falling [[Glasgow Coma Scale|GCS]]

## Diagnostic Tests

- **CT Scan:** Imaging to visualize the hematoma and assess its size and location.
- Skull XR may be normal or show fracture lines

_LUMBAR PUNCTURE IS CONTRAINDICATED due to $\uparrow$ ICP_

## Management

Extradural Hematomas are considered surgical emergencies, and treatment involves:

1. **Craniotomy:** Surgical removal of the hematoma to relieve pressure on the brain.
2. **Medications:** To control symptoms, manage seizures, and reduce brain swelling.

## Complications/red Flags

Poor prognosis if not diagnosed and operated on quickly

- **Increased Intracranial Pressure:** Can lead to brain herniation, a life-threatening condition.
- **Neurological Deficits:** Depending on the size and location of the hematoma.
