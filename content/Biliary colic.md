Biliary colic is the most common complication of **gallstones**. It refers to the **acute, painful spasm** of the **gallbladder wall** due to a gallstone temporarily blocking the neck of the gallbladder, cystic duct or common bile duct.1,2

With the flow of bile being obstructed, the **pressure increases**, so the gallbladder **contracts** to try and push the bile past the gallstone, further increasing the pressure against the gallbladder wall, resulting in **visceral pain**.3

Biliary colic tends to be preceded by a **fatty meal**


- May have risk factors for gallstones
- Episodes of sudden onset, severe, colicky RUQ pain, may be provoked by meals
- **Systemically well patient** (not an inflammatory condition)
- Normal inflammatory markers (WCC, CRP) and liver function tests
- Abdominal ultrasound best investigation
- May require elective cholecystectomy
