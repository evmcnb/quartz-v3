## Introduction

- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)
- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves - using patient friendly language
- Explain the need for a chaperone *“One of the female ward staff members will be present throughout the examination, acting as a chaperone, would that be ok?”*
- Check patient understanding and gain consent to continue
- Over a gown if able
- Ask if they have any pain before proceeding
- **If a patient is concerned about a lump as for its location**

## General Inspection

**Ask the patient to undress down to the waist to adequately expose their breasts**

#### Clinical Signs

- Asymmetry
- Swelling
- Masses
- Skin changes
- Nipple changes

> [!info] Nipple abnormalities
> **Nipple inversion** is a normal finding in a significant proportion of women (e.g. congenital or weight-loss associated nipple inversion). However, if nipple inversion develops without a clear precipitant, the possibility of underlying pathology should be considered. Possible pathological causes of nipple inversion include breast cancer, breast abscess, mammary duct ectasia and mastitis.
>
> **Nipple discharge** is benign is most cases (e.g. pregnancy, breast-feeding) however less commonly it can be associated with mastitis or underlying breast cancer (rare).

> [!info] Skin changes
>
> **Scaling** of the nipple and/or areola associated with erythema and pruritis are typical features of Paget’s disease of the breast (see the example image). Paget’s disease is associated with underlying in-situ or invasive carcinoma of the breast.
>
> **Erythema** of the breast tissue has a wide range of causes including infection (e.g. mastitis or breast abscess), trauma (e.g. fat necrosis) and underlying breast cancer.
>
> **Puckering** of breast tissue is typically associated with invasion of the suspensory ligaments of the breast by an underlying malignancy that results in ligamentous contraction which draws the skin inwards.
>
> **Peau d’orange** (dimpling of the skin resembling an orange peel) occurs due to cutaenous lymphatic oedema. The dimples represent tethering of the swollen skin to hair follicles and sweat glands. Peau d’orange is typically associated with inflammatory breast cancer.

## Exaggerating manoeuvres

**Repeat inspection** in the following positions:

1. <span style="color:#ff0000">Hands pushing into hips (to contract pec muscles)</span> -<span style="color:#00b0f0"> if a visible mass moves it suggests tethering</span>
2. <span style="color:#ff0000">Arms above head and leaning forward</span> -<span style="color:#00b0f0"> exaggerating asymmetry, skin dimpling or puckering</span>

## Palpation

**Adjust the bed to 45 degrees and ask the patient to lie down**

Only expose one breast at a time

- <span style="color:#ff0000">Begin palpation on the asymptomatic breast</span> first and then repeat all steps on contralateral breast.
- Ask patient to<span style="color:#ff0000"> place the hand on the side that's being examined behind their head</span>
- Use a systematic method of palpation to ensure all areas of the breast are examined
- Use the **flats** of your **middle three fingers** to **compress the breast tissue** against the **chest** **wall**, as you feel for any **masses**. If a mass is detected, assess the following characteristics:
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Location</span> - which quadrant and how far away from the nipple
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Size & shape</span>- approx dimensions & shape
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Consistency</span> - smooth/firm/stony/rubbery
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Mobility</span> - does it move freely/with overlying skin/muscle?
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Fluctuance</span> - hold the mass by the sides and apply pressure to feel if sides bulge outwards indicating that it is fluid filled (cyst)
  - <span style="color:#00ffff">Overlying skin changes</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Continue palpation towards the axilla</span>

## Lymph nodes

**Ensure dignitiy and modest are maintained** - dependant on gown given

### Axilla

1. Ensure the patient is lying down at 45$\degree$
2. Ask if the patient has any pain in shoulder before moving arm
3. <span style="color:#ff0000">Inspect each axilla for evidence of scars, masses or skin changes</span>
4. <span style="color:#ff0000">Hold the patients arm</span> in your hand and ask them to relax
5. Palpation should be performed with the other hand
6. <span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate from the lateral edge of the pec major muscle to the anterior edge of lats to the inner aspect of the arm</span>
7. Repeat for other arm

## Other lymph nodes

<span style="color:#ff0000">Ask the patient to sit up</span>

Palpate:

- Cervical
- Supraclavicular
- Infraclavicular
- Parasternal

## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.

## Further Assessments and Investigations

- Mammography - usually over age of 35
- USS - used in patients under 35 due to increase density of breast tissue
- Biopsy - fine-needle aspiration or core biopsy may be considered if a breast lump needs further assessment
