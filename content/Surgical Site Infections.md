Prophylactic antibiotics are given to counter the risk of wound infection which occurs in ~20% of elective surgeries and up to 60% in emergency surgery  

1. **Staphylococcus aureus:** This bacterium, particularly the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
2. **Escherichia coli (E. coli):** Gram-negative
3. **Enterococci:** These bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, particularly in abdominal and pelvic surgeries.
4. **Pseudomonas aeruginosa:** Gram-negative
5. **Clostridium perfringens:** This anaerobic bacterium can cause infections in wounds with poor blood supply and low oxygen levels.
6. **Bacteroides fragilis:** Another anaerobic bacterium, especially in abdominal surgeries.
7. **Candida species:** Fungal infections, particularly those caused by Candida albicans, especially in immunocompromised patients or in surgeries involving the gastrointestinal tract.

Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be used routinely for clean non-prosthetic uncomplicated surgery because of the risk of adverse events,Â _Clostridium difficile_-associated disease, resistance and drug hypersensitivity.

| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Clean              | Incising uninfected skin without opening a viscus                                         | <2%            |
| Clean-contaminated | Intra-operative breach of viscus (but not colon)                                          | 8-10%          |
| Contaminated       | Breach of viscus + spillage or opening of colon                                           | 12-20%         |
| Dirty              | The site is already contaminated with pus or faeces or from exogenous contagion eg trauma | 25%               |

- IV antibiotics given 30 mins prior to surgery to maximise skin concentration
- Use antibiotics that will kill anaerobes and coliforms 
- For MRSA colonised patients add teicoplanin or vancomycin
