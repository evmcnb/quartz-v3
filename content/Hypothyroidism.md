- Hy**po** so low mood, slow, lethargic gain weight etc

- Most common in women and older people

## Causes/Factors

The most common cause of hypothyroidism is autoimmune thyroiditis, also known as [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]. Other factors and causes include:

- **Iodine Deficiency:** Inadequate intake of iodine, a crucial component for thyroid hormone production.
- **Surgical Removal of Thyroid:** Thyroidectomy or partial thyroidectomy.
- **Radiation Therapy:** For head and neck cancers.
- **Medications:** Certain drugs, such as lithium and amiodarone, can affect thyroid function.

## Symptoms

Symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary in severity and may include:

- **Fatigue:** Profound tiredness and low energy.
- **Weight Gain:** Unexplained weight gain or difficulty losing weight.
- **Cold Sensitivity:** Feeling unusually cold, especially in extremities.
- **Dry Skin and Hair:** Skin may become dry and hair brittle.
- **Constipation:** Difficulty with regular bowel movements.
- **Depression:** Mood changes, including depression and irritability.
- **Muscle Weakness:** Weakness and aching in muscles.
- **Joint Pain:** Aches and pains in the joints.

## Signs

- **Enlarged Thyroid (Goiter):** Swelling of the thyroid gland in some cases.
- **Slowed Reflexes:** Delayed reflex responses.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing hypothyroidism involves blood tests, including:

- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Measuring levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
- **Antithyroid Antibody Test:** To check for autoimmune causes.
- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging to assess thyroid gland size and structure.

## Management

Treatment of hypothyroidism typically involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy with synthetic thyroid hormones, such as levothyroxine. The goal is to restore thyroid hormone levels to normal and alleviate symptoms.

## Complications/Red Flags

Untreated or inadequately managed hypothyroidism can lead to complications, including:

- **Cardiovascular Issues:** Elevated cholesterol levels and an increased risk of heart disease.
- **Mental Health Problems:** Increased risk of depression and cognitive impairment.
- **[[Myxedema]]:** A rare but life-threatening condition characterized by extreme hypothyroidism.
