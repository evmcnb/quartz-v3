The commonest liver disorder in Western industrialised countries. A range of conditions caused by a build up of fat in hepatocytes. Usually seen in people who are overweight or obese

Most people will only ever develop the first stage - but subsequent stages are serious. There are 4 main stages:

1. Simple fatty liver (steatosis) usually asymptomatic
2. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - a more serious form of NAFLD where the liver has become inflamed
3. Fibrosis - where persistent inflammation causes scar tissue around the liver and nearby blood vessels. Liver can still function normally
4. [[Liver Cirrhosis]] - the most severe stage occurring after years. Permanent damage and can lead to liver failure
