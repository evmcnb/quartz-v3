## Quick reference
Neuro exams always try to localise where in the pathway the lesion is: upper (brain, spinal cord) or lower (nerve root, peripheral nerve, NMJ or muscle). Here's a summary of the features from UMN, remember upp**er**, hyp**er**

| Test       | UMN signs                                                                                                     | LMN                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Inspection | No fasciculation or significant wasting (there may however be some disuse atrophy or contractures)            | Wasting and fasciculation of muscles |
| Tone       | Increased (spasticity or rigidity) +/- ankle clonus                                                           | Decreased (hypotonia) or normal      |
| Power      | Classically a “pyramidal” pattern of weakness (extensors weaker than flexors in arms, and vice versa in legs) |                                      |
