Reduced bone mass

Primary - age related
Secondary - to another condition or drug

If trabecular bone is affected, crush fractures of vertebrae are common.
If cortical bone is affected, long bone fractures are more likely [[Hip Fractures]]


## Causes/Factors

SHATTERED for osteoporosis risk factors

**S**teroid use of >5mg/day of prednisolone
**H**[[Hyperthyroidism|yperthyroidism]], hyperparathyroidism, hypercalciuria 
**A**lcohol and tobacco use
**T**hin - BMI < 18.5
**T**estosterone $\downarrow$
**E**arly menopause 
**R**enal or liver failure
**E**rosive/inflammatory bone disease - [[Multiple myeloma]] or [[Inflammatory Arthritis]]
**D**ietary low calcium absorption - T1 [[Diabetes Mellitus]]

## Symptoms

- Associated fractures
- Loss of height 

## Diagnostic Tests

- Diagnosing osteoporosis involves a bone density test, typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). This test measures bone mineral density (BMD) and assesses the risk of fractures.
- Bloods - Ca, PO4, ALP (for bone mets) 

Biopsy unreliable and unnecessary 

## Management

May not be entirely irreversible 

1. **Calcium and Vitamin D Supplements:** Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are essential for bone health.
2. **Lifestyle Changes:** Regular weight-bearing exercises, quitting smoking, and moderating alcohol intake.
3. **Medications:** Various medications, including bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, and denosumab, may be prescribed to strengthen bones.
4. **Fall Prevention:** Taking steps to prevent falls, such as using assistive devices and making home modifications.
5. **Fracture Management:** Treatment of fractures if they occur, including pain management and rehabilitation.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Fractures:** The main complication of osteoporosis, fractures can lead to pain, disability, and a decreased quality of life.
- **Loss of Independence:** Severe fractures, especially hip fractures, can lead to a loss of independence.
