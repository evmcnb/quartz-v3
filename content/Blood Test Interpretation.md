# Full Blood Count 

| **Component** | **What the Test Shows** | **High Levels (Possible Causes)** | **Low Levels (Possible Causes)** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **Hemoglobin (Hb)** | Oxygen-carrying capacity of red blood cells. | - Dehydration | - [[Anaemia]] (iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency) |
|  |  | - [[polycythaemia]] (increased red blood cell production) | - Chronic diseases ([[Chronic Kidney Disease]], inflammation) |
|  |  |  | - Blood loss (bleeding, menstruation) |
| **Hematocrit (Hct)** | Volume of red blood cells as a percentage of total blood volume. | - Dehydration | - Anemia (iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency) |
|  |  | - Polycythemia (increased red blood cell production) | - Chronic diseases (chronic kidney disease, inflammation) |
|  |  |  | - Blood loss (bleeding, menstruation) |
| **White Blood Cells** | Immune system response to infections and other diseases. | - Infection or inflammation | - Bone marrow disorders (aplastic anemia) |
| **Red Blood Cells** | Quantity of red blood cells in a specific volume of blood. | - Polycythemia (increased red blood cell production) | - Anemia (iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency) |
|  |  | - Dehydration | - Chronic diseases (chronic kidney disease, inflammation) |
|  |  |  | - Blood loss (bleeding, menstruation) |
| **MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume)** | Average volume of red blood cells. | - Macrocytic anemia (larger than normal red blood cells) | - Microcytic anemia (smaller than normal red blood cells) |
| **PCV (Packed Cell Volume)** | Volume of red blood cells as a percentage of total blood volume. | - Dehydration | - Anemia (iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency) |
|  |  | - Polycythemia (increased red blood cell production) | - Chronic diseases (chronic kidney disease, inflammation) |
|  |  |  | - Blood loss (bleeding, menstruation) |
| **MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration)** | Concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells. | - Spherocytosis (a type of anemia where red blood cells are spherical) | - Hypochromic anemia (lower than normal hemoglobin content in red cells) |
| **RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width)** | Variation in size of red blood cells. | - Iron deficiency anemia | - Normal iron levels, recent blood transfusion |
| **Platelets** | Blood clotting ability and risk of bleeding. | - Infection or inflammation | - Bone marrow disorders (thrombocytopenia) |
|  |  | - Certain medications (chemotherapy) | - Autoimmune disorders (immune thrombocytopenia) |
| **Neutrophils** | Type of white blood cells involved in bacterial infection. | - Infection (bacterial) | - Bone marrow disorders (aplastic anemia) |
| **Lymphocytes** | Type of white blood cells involved in viral infections. | - Viral infections (e.g., influenza, HIV) | - Immune deficiency disorders |
| **Monocytes** | Type of white blood cells involved in immune response. | - Chronic inflammatory conditions | - Bone marrow disorders (aplastic anemia) |
| **Eosinophils** | Type of white blood cells involved in allergic reactions. | - Allergic reactions | - [[Hyperthyroidism]] |
| **Basophils** | Type of white blood cells involved in allergic reactions. | - Allergic reactions | - [[Hypothyroidism]] |



# Liver Function Tests

| **LFT Component** | **Reference Range** | **High Levels (Possible Causes)** | **Low Levels (Possible Causes)** | **What the Test Shows** |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **1. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)** | 7 to 56 units/L (may vary slightly between labs) | - Liver inflammation (hepatitis) | - Malnutrition, especially severe protein deficiency | Indicates liver cell damage, particularly hepatocellular. |
| **2. Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)** | 10 to 40 units/L (may vary slightly between labs) | - Liver inflammation (hepatitis) | - Malnutrition, especially severe protein deficiency | Indicates liver cell damage; not specific to the liver. |
| **3. Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP)** | 44 to 147 units/L (may vary slightly between labs) | - Biliary obstruction (cholestasis) | - Malnutrition, especially severe protein deficiency | Reflects liver or bone disease; additional tests help pinpoint. |
| **4. Total Bilirubin** | 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dL | - Liver disease, hemolysis | - Gilbert syndrome (mild increase) | Measures breakdown product of hemoglobin; assesses liver function. |
| **5. Direct Bilirubin** | 0 to 0.3 mg/dL | - Biliary obstruction (cholestasis) | - Reduced liver function due to severe disease or failure | Measures bilirubin that has been processed by the liver. |
| **6. Albumin** | 3.4 to 5.4 g/dL | - Liver disease, malnutrition | - Kidney disease, malabsorption | Measures protein produced by the liver; assesses liver function. |
| **7. Total Protein** | 6.0 to 8.3 g/dL | - Liver disease, inflammation, dehydration | - Malnutrition, malabsorption, kidney disease | Reflects overall protein levels in the blood. |
| **8. Prothrombin Time (PT)** | 10 to 14 seconds | - Liver disease, decreased vitamin K absorption | - Blood clotting disorders, anticoagulant medication use | Measures the time it takes for blood to clot. |
