## Causes/Factors

- Increasing age
- Family history
- Black ethnic origin
- Myopia (nearsightedness)

## Clinical Features

Glaucoma affects the **_peripheral vision_** first, resulting in a **_gradual onset_** of **_peripheral vision loss_** (**_tunnel vision_**). It can also cause:

- Fluctuating pain
- Headaches
- Blurred vision 
- Halos around lights, particularly at night

## Investigations

Both apply pressure to cornea and measure response/resistance
- Non-contact tonometry (less accurate)
- Goldmann applanation tonometry (gold standard)

- Slit lamp assessment for the cup-disk ratio ([eye anatomy](https://www.nosos.co.uk/facts/glaucoma-pathophysiology/))
- Visual field assessment for peripheral vision loss
- Gonioscopy to assess angle between iris and cornea

## Management

Treatment started at an intraocular pressure of 24mmHg or above

**Medications**:
- Prostaglandin analgue eye drops (latanoprost) first line - increase uveoscleral outflow
- Beta-blockers (timolol) reduce the production of aqueous humour
- Carbonic anhyrase inhibitors (dorzolamide) reduce the production...
- Sympathomimetics (brimonidine) does both

**Surgical**: 360$\degree$ selective laser trabeculoplasty 
- Laser directed at the trabecular meshwork, improving drainage
- A second procedure may be needed at a later date

## Complications/red Flags

- Irreversible loss of vision (partial or complete) is the main complication of untreated glaucoma.
- However angle closure glaucoma is considerably more likely than open angle glaucoma to cause blindness
