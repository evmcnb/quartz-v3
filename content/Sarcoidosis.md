Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, most commonly the lungs and lymph nodes. The condition is characterized by the formation of small clumps of inflammatory cells, known as granulomas, in various parts of the body. Sarcoidosis can have a wide range of symptoms and can affect people of any age, gender, or ethnic background.

## Causes/Factors

The exact cause of sarcoidosis is still unknown. It is believed to result from an abnormal immune response triggered by exposure to certain environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. These factors might include infections, chemicals, or allergens. Genetic factors may also play a role in increasing the risk of developing sarcoidosis.

## Symptoms

Sarcoidosis can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the organs involved:

- **Lungs:** Persistent dry cough, shortness of breath, chest pain.
- **Skin:** Rash, nodules, or red or discoloured patches.
- **Eyes:** Burning, itching, redness, dryness, and in severe cases, blurred vision or even blindness.
- **Lymph Nodes:** Enlarged and tender lymph nodes, particularly around the neck, armpits, and groin.
- **Joints:** Joint pain and stiffness.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling unusually tired and lacking energy.
- **Fever:** Low-grade fever.

## Signs

- **Skin Lesions:** Discoloured or raised areas of skin.
- **Lymph Node Enlargement:** Palpable, tender lymph nodes.
- **Eye Involvement:** Redness, swelling, or other eye-related symptoms.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing sarcoidosis can be complex due to its diverse manifestations. Diagnostic tests may include:

- **Chest X-ray:** To identify lung involvement and granuloma formation.
- **Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):** Measures lung capacity and function.
- **Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a tissue sample (often from the lungs or skin) to confirm the presence of granulomas.
- **Blood Tests:** To rule out other conditions and assess markers of inflammation.
- **Eye Examination:** To detect eye involvement.

## Management

Sarcoidosis can have a variable course, ranging from mild and self-limiting to chronic and progressive. Treatment depends on the severity of symptoms and the organs affected:

1. **Observation:** Mild cases may not require treatment and may resolve on their own.
2. **Corticosteroids:** Prednisone and other steroids to reduce inflammation.
3. **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** For cases not responding to corticosteroids.
4. **Topical Treatment:** Creams or ointments for skin lesions.
5. **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers for joint discomfort.

## Complications/Red Flags

Severe sarcoidosis can lead to complications:

- **Organ Damage:** Chronic inflammation can damage affected organs.
- **Scarring:** Severe lung involvement can lead to pulmonary fibrosis.
- **Eye Complications:** Severe eye involvement can result in blindness.
- **Heart and Nervous System Involvement:** Rare but serious complications.
