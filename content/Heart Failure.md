Defined as when cardiac output is inadequate for the body's normal requirements. End stage of all cardiac pathologies

## Classifications

**Systolic failure** - inability of the ventricle to contract normally resulting in $\downarrow$ CO. Ejection fraction <40%

**Diastolic failure** - Inability of the ventricle to relax and fill normally causing $\uparrow$ filling pressure. EF >50% - preserved ejection fraction


**Left ventricular failure**
- Dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance, fatigue, orthopnoea, cardiac "asthma"

**Right ventricular failure**
- Peripheral oedema, ascites, nausea, anorexia
- Causes: LVF, pulmonary stenosis, [[cor pulmonale]]


**Acute heart failure** - new-onset acute or decompensation of chronic heart failure with pulmonary and peripheral oedema without peripheral hypoperfusion

**Chronic heart failure** - Develops slowly, venous congestion is common but arterial pressure is well maintained


**Low-output heart failure** - $\downarrow$ CO which fails to increase on exercise. Causes
- Excessive pre-load: mitral regurgitation or fluid overload
- Pump failure: systolic/diastolic heart failure, $\downarrow$ HR (eg $\beta$ blockers)
- Chronic excess afterload: aortic stenosis, [[Essential hypertension|hypertension]]

**High-output heart failure** - rare, normal or increase CO with demand
## Causes/Factors

Systolic and diastolic failure pathology often coexist

Systolic:

- [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
- [[myocardial infarction]]
- myocarditis
- dilated cardiomyopathy

Diastolic:

- ventricular hypertrophy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)
- [[Pericarditis]]
- [[Cardiac Tamponade]]

## Symptoms

- Fatigue
- Dyspnoea
- Orthopnoea
- Paroxysmal nocturnal (breathless at night)

## Signs

- High JV pressure
- Tachycardia
- Hypotension
- Cachexia (loss of skeletal muscle)

## Diagnostic Tests

- Echo to assess ejection fraction, ventricle dilation and valves
- ECG
- Bloods: NT-proBNP (N-Terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide)
- CXR?

## Management

Chronic:

- Treat the cause
- Treat exacerbating factors (anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, $\uparrow$ BP)
- Avoid exacerbating factors
- If irreversible LVAD (left ventricular assist device) may be implanted
- Heart transplant

Drugs:

- ACE-inhibitor promotes removal of excess fluid (ARB if ACEi not tolerated)
- $\beta$ blocker decreases heart rate and increases force of contraction
- Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist eg spironolactone
- SGLT2i (causes peeing out glucose) eg forxiga, dapagliflozin

- Loop diuretics - eg furosemide (no prognostic benefit) but symptomatic benefit
## Complications/red Flags

- Arrythmias
- Thromboembolism
