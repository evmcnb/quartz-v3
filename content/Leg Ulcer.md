Ulcer - loss of area of epidermis and dermis to produce a defect even down to fat, muscle, tendons and bone

Erosion - loss of area of epidermis

## Causes

Vascular 90%

- Venous 70%
- Arterial 10%
- Mixed 10%

Other 10%

Rarer causes

- Neuropathic - [[peripheral neuropathy]] <- [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- Inflammatory - [[pyoderma gangrenosum]]
- Malignant - SCC, BCC, lymphoma
- Vascular - [[vasculitis]]
- Iatrogenic - pressure sores, drugs (warfarin necrosis)
- Infection
- Metabolic
- Traumatic - burns

## Risk Factors

Venous:

- middle aged elderly women
- valvular incompetence
- previous damage to venous system
- obesity, immobility -> poor muscle contraction -> venous pooling

- high BP
- multiple pregnancies

Arterial:

- associated with [[peripheral vascular disease]]
- smoking
- hyperlipidemia
- hypercholesterolemia

## Signs

Venous - smooth sloping border, superficial, ill defined border

- Venous flare
- Lipodermatosclerosis
- Varicose veins
- Varicose eczema
- Atrophie blanche

Arterial - punched out painful ulcer, dry skin,

## Diagnostic Tests

- skin biopsy if cannot determine cause or exclude skin malignancy
- Ankle brachial pressure index
- depends on suspected underlying cause

## Management

- Treat the underlying cause
- Venous ulcer - compression stocking/bandage
- Pentoxifylline - increases microvascular blood flow

## Complications/red Flags
