Localised damage to the skin due to pressure in combination with a shearing force.

Usually occur over a bony prominence - but may be related to a medical device/other objects

| Stage       | Observation                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| Stage I     | non-blanchable               |
| Stage II    | partial thickness            |
| Stage III   | full thickness skin loss     |
| Stage IV    | full thickness tissue loss   |
| Injury      | suspected deep tissue injury |
| Unstageable | full thickness skin or tissue loss                             |

## Causes/Factors

- Reduced mobility
- Nutritional deficiency
- Older age
- Poor vascular supply to skin and soft tissues ([[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[peripheral vascular disease]])

## Locations

## Investigations

Are not used to make the diagnosis but may be required if the diagnosis is uncertain and to exclude complications
- Wound swabs only if infection suspected
- ABPI
- HbA1c
## Management

- Nutritional risk assessment
- Pressure redistributing devices
- Debriding the wound if indicated
- Regular turns in bed
- Encourage mobility
- Antibiotics look up local guidelines/discuss with micro
- Appropriate wound dressings 

## Complications/red Flags

- Pain 
- Infection
- Increased mortality 5x in older patients - longer hospital stays
