# Brief Overview

Hyperthyroidism is a medical condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland. Thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), play a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism. When the thyroid gland becomes overactive and releases an excessive amount of these hormones into the bloodstream, it leads to a state of hyperthyroidism. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave's disease]].

## Causes/Factors

1. **[[Grave's disease]]:** An autoimmune disorder where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroid hormones. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism
2. **Toxic Multinodular Goiter:** The thyroid gland develops multiple nodules that produce thyroid hormones independently, leading to an overproduction of hormones.
3. **Toxic Adenoma:** A single nodule in the thyroid gland becomes overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones.
4. **Subacute Thyroiditis:** Inflammation of the thyroid gland causes the release of stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream.
5. **Excessive Iodine Intake:** Consuming a high amount of iodine, either through diet or medication, can lead to hyperthyroidism.
6. **Medications:** Certain medications containing iodine or thyroid hormones can induce hyperthyroidism as a side effect.

## Symptoms

- **Weight Loss:** Unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite.
- **Nervousness and Irritability:** Feeling anxious, jittery, or easily agitated.
- **Heat Intolerance:** Feeling excessively hot in normal temperatures.
- **Increased Sweating:** Perspiring more than usual, especially in the hands and feet.
- **Tremors:** Fine trembling of the hands and fingers.
- **Palpitations:** Rapid or irregular heartbeat.
- **Fatigue:** Feeling tired and weak even without physical exertion.
- **Muscle Weakness:** Experiencing muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs.
- **Frequent Bowel Movements:** Having more frequent and sometimes loose bowel movements.
- **Changes in Menstrual Patterns:** Irregular menstrual periods in women.

## Signs

- **Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter):** The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.
  - Smooth = Grave's disease
  - Nodular = toxic nodules
  - Tender = thyroid inflammation
- **Tachycardia:** Abnormally fast heart rate.
- **Exophthalmos:** In Grave's disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Thyroid Function Tests:** Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
- **Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU):** Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity.
- **Thyroid Scintigraphy:** Imaging test using radioactive iodine to identify nodules or areas of increased thyroid activity.
- **Thyroid Ultrasound:** Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland.
- **Antibody Tests:** To detect antibodies associated with Grave's disease.

## Management

1. **Antithyroid Medications:** Drugs like Methimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) can lower thyroid hormone production.
2. **Beta-Blockers:** Used to manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat and tremors.
3. **Radioactive Iodine Therapy:** Destroys part of the thyroid gland to reduce hormone production.
4. **Surgery (Thyroidectomy):** Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland in certain cases.
5. **Iodine Restriction:** Limiting iodine intake to reduce hormone production in the thyroid gland.

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Thyroid Storm:** A life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms, which requires immediate medical attention.
- **Osteoporosis:** Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.
- **Heart Problems:** Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure.
- **[[Pregnancy]] Complications:** Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.
