## Chest

#### Inspect

-   <span style="color:#ff0000">Spider naevi</span>: skin lesions caused by <span style="color:#00ffff">increased levels of circulating oestrogen</span>. Can be a normal finding in pregnancy or in women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill. If more than 5 are present it is more likely to be associated with pathology such as [[Liver Cirrhosis]].
-   <span style="color:#ff0000">Gynaecomastia</span>: enlargement of male breast tissue caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Other causes include medications such as digoxin and spironolactone.

## Abdomen

Position the patient lying flat on the bed.
#### Inspect
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Scars</span> - past surgery

## Abdominal Palpation
Ask the patient if they are aware of any areas of abdominal pain (if present examine last). Keep good eye contact to look for discomfort. 

![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20231204145145.png|211]]
### Light Palpation of the Abdomen
- Tenderness 
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Rebound tenderness</span>: said to be present when the abdominal wall, having been compressed slowly, is released rapidly and results in sudden sharp abdominal pain. Weakly <span style="color:#00ffff">associated with peritonitis</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Voluntary guarding</span>: contraction of the abdominal muscles in response to pain
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Involuntary guarding/rigidity</span>: involuntary tension in the abdominal muscles that occurs on palpation associated with <span style="color:#00ffff">peritonitis (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis).</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Masses</span>: large or superficial masses (e.g. <span style="color:#00ffff">hernias</span>) may be noted on light palpation.


### Deep Palpation
Warn the patient this may feel uncomfortable - carefully monitor face
If any **masses** are identified during deep palpation, assess the following characteristics:

-   **Location:** note which of the nine abdominal regions the mass located within.
-   **Size and shape:** assess the approximate size and shape of the mass.
-   **Consistency:** assess the consistency of the mass (e.g. smooth, soft, hard, irregular).
-   **Mobility:** assess if the mass appears to be attached to superficial or underlying structures.
-   **Pulsatility:** note if the mass feels pulsatile, suggestive of vascular aetiology (e.g. abdominal aortic aneurysm).


##### <span style="color:#ff0000"> Palpate Liver</span>
1. Begin in right iliac fossa starting using flat edge of right hand
2. Ask patient to take deep breath in palpate on the inspiration and see if can feel edge of liver
3. Repeat process moving 1-2cm superiorly each time
4.  If you are able to identify the **liver edge**, assess the following characteristics:
	- <span style="color:#ff0000">Degree of extension below the costal margin</span>: if greater than 2 cm this suggests <span style="color:#00ffff">hepatomegaly</span>.
	- <span style="color:#ff0000">Consistency of the liver edge</span>: a nodular consistency is suggestive of <span style="color:#00ffff">cirrhosis</span>.
	- <span style="color:#ff0000">Tenderness</span>: hepatic tenderness may suggest <span style="color:#00ffff">hepatitis or cholecystitis</span> (as you may be palpating the gallbladder)
	- <span style="color:#ff0000">Pulsatility</span>: pulsatile hepatomegaly is associated with <span style="color:#00ffff">tricuspid regurgitation.</span>

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate Gallbladder</span>
In healthy individuals the gallbladder isn't usually palpable. If palpable suggests enlargement secondary to biliary flow obstruction and/or infection ([[Cholecystitis]])
**Murphy's sign**
1. Position fingers at the right costal margin in mid-clavicular line
2. Ask patient to take a deep breath
3. If patient suddenly stops mid-breath due to pain, suggests [[Cholecystitis]] - <span style="color:#00ffff">Murphy's sign </span>positive

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate the Spleen</span>
- Same process and beginning as liver but move towards left costal margin instead of right
In healthy individuals you should not be able to palpate the spleen.

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Ballot the Kidneys</span>
1. Place hands in this position and push fingers together
![|325](z_attachments/325-1.png)
2. Ask patient to take a deep breath and feel for kidney moving down
3. If kidney ballotable describe size and consistency
4. Repeat on other side
In healthy individuals the kidneys are not usually ballotable but in low BMI patients might be possible
-   <span style="color:#ff0000">Bilaterally enlarged</span>, ballotable kidneys can occur in [[Polycystic Kidney Disease]] <span style="color:#00ffff">or</span> [[amyloidosis]].
-   <span style="color:#ff0000">A unilaterally enlarged</span>, ballotable kidney can be caused by a <span style="color:#00ffff">renal tumour</span>.

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate the Aorta</span>
**1.** Using both hands perform deep palpation just superior to the umbilicus in the midline.
**2.** Note the movement of your fingers should be superiorly not laterally which might suggest an expansile mass (AAA)

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate the Bladder</span>
Warm might be uncomfortable and made cause the urge to go to the toilet.
A distended bladder can be palpated in the **suprapubic area** arising from behind the **pubic symphysis** (e.g. urinary obstruction/retention). In most healthy patients who are passing urine regularly, the bladder will **not** be palpable.
- Use side of left hand to palpate from umbilical region downwards


## Abdominal Percussion

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Percuss the Liver</span>
1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **right costal margin** until the percussion note changes to dull
2. Continue to percuss upward until the note changes back to resonant indicating the upper border
3. Determine approximate size of liver

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Percuss the Spleen</span>
1. Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards **left costal margin**
2. The spleen should not be identifiable using percussion in healthy patients

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Percuss the Bladder</span>
1. Percuss downwards in the midline from the umbilical region towards the pubic symphysis
2. A distended bladder will be dull to percussion

##### <span style="color:#ff0000">Assess Shifting Dullness</span>
1. Percuss from the umbilical region to patients left flank - if dullness noted - may suggest ascitic fluid
2. Whilst keeping fingers over the area at which the note became dull, ask patient to roll onto their side
3. Keep patient on their side for 30 seconds and then repeat percussion over the same area
4. If ascites is present the area should now be resonant 


## Abdominal Auscultation

#### Assess Bowl Sounds
**Auscultate** over **at least two** **positions** on the abdomen to **assess bowel sounds**:

-   Normal bowel sounds: typically described as gurgling (listen to an example in our video demonstration)
-   <span style="color:#ff0000">Tinkling bowel sounds</span>: typically associated with <span style="color:#00ffff">bowel obstruction</span>.
-   <span style="color:#ff0000">Absent bowel sounds</span>: suggests ileus which is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine due to a <span style="color:#00ffff">malfunction of peristalsis</span>.

#### Listen for Bruits
**Auscultate** over the **aorta** and **renal arteries** to identify **vascular** **bruits** suggestive of turbulent blood flow:

-   **Aortic bruits:** auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus, a bruit here may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
-   **Renal bruits:** auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus and slightly lateral to the midline on each side. A bruit in this location may be associated with renal artery stenosis.

## Legs
Assess the patient’s **lower legs** for evidence of **pitting oedema** which may suggest **hypoalbuminemia** (e.g. [[Liver Cirrhosis]], protein-losing enteropathy).


## To Complete the Exam
- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.

## Further Assessments and Investigations
-   Check hernial orifices (e.g. if there are signs of bowel obstruction). 
-   If there is suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding perform a PR exam.
-  To rule out testicular torsion or indirect inguinal hernia a external genitalia exam may be needed
