## Dermatophytosis

Dermatophytes digest **keratin** and so can cause infection of skin and keratiniszed structures - hair & nails. Tinea corporis, pedis, capitis, unguium

#### Causes

- **Dermatophyte Fungi:** Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton.
- **Warm and Moist Environments:** Fungi thrive in warm, humid conditions.
- **Direct Contact:** From infected people, animals, or surfaces.
- **Immunocompromised State:** Weakened immune system increases susceptibility.
- **Poor Hygiene:** Lack of proper skin and nail hygiene.

#### Clinical Presentations

- **Tinea Corporis (Ringworm):** Circular, red, scaly lesions.
- **Tinea Cruris (Jock Itch):** Rash in the groin area, extending to inner thighs.
- **Tinea Pedis (Athlete's Foot):** Itchy, scaly rash on feet, especially between toes - up to 15% of population
- **Tinea Capitis:** Scalp involvement causing hair loss and scaling.
- **Tinea Unguium (Onychomycosis):** Fungal nail infection, causing discoloration and thickening.

## Superficial candidiasis

Usually commensal in mouth, vagina and GI tract

#### Causes 

- Immunosuppression (steroid inhalers)
- Antibiotic treatment (opportunistic)

#### Clinical Presentation

- **Oropharyngeal:** white patches on erythematous background (plaque).
- **Skin:** usually in folds interdigital (intertrigo)

## Malassezia

Commensals of greasy skin

#### Presentation:

- **Pityriasis versicolor:** scaly hypo/hyperpigmented rash with scaling

# Management

1. **Topical Antifungals:** (e.g., Clotrimazole, Miconazole) for localized infections.
2. **Oral Antifungals:** (e.g., Terbinafine, Fluconazole) for extensive or severe infections.
3. **Proper Hygiene:** Keep affected areas clean and dry; avoid shared items.
4. **Address Contributing Factors:** Control moisture, especially in sweating-prone areas.

# Complications/Red Flags

- **Secondary Bacterial Infection:** Scratching may lead to bacterial superinfection.
- **Chronic or Recurrent Infections:** Suggest potential underlying factors.
- **Spread to Other Areas:** Especially without proper treatment.
