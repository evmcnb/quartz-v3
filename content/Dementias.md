| Type of Dementia   | Common Symptoms                           | Pathology                          | Risk Factors                       | Treatment/Management                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Alzheimer's Disease**| Memory loss, confusion, language problems  | Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles in the brain | Age, family history, genetics, certain genes, head injuries, cardiovascular disease, diabetes | Medications (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine), cognitive and behavioral therapies, lifestyle modifications (e.g., physical and mental activities, healthy diet, social engagement) |
| **Vascular Dementia**  | Problems with reasoning, planning, memory | Reduced blood flow to the brain, often after a stroke or other cardiovascular issues | Hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), atrial fibrillation | Blood pressure management, cholesterol control, diabetes management, lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, diet), cognitive rehabilitation |
| **Lewy Body Dementia** | Fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations | Lewy bodies (abnormal protein deposits), cognitive and motor symptoms | Age, family history, Parkinson's disease, REM sleep behavior disorder | Medications for symptoms (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotics), physical therapy, occupational therapy, support for both the person and caregivers |
| **Frontotemporal Dementia** | Personality and behavior changes, language problems | Abnormal protein deposits in the frontal and temporal lobes | Genetic mutations (in some cases), family history | Behavioral and symptom management, speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, supportive care |


### Causes/Factors
1. **Alzheimer's Disease**: Abnormal protein accumulation (amyloid plaques, tau tangles) - slow progression
2. **Vascular Dementia**: Impaired blood flow to the brain due to stroke or other vascular issues.
3. **Lewy Body Dementia**: Presence of abnormal protein deposits (alpha-synuclein) in the brain.- often associated with [[Parkinson's disease]]. No anti-psychotics ^5b78b4
4. **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Degeneration of frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

### Symptoms
1. **Cognitive Decline**: Memory loss, difficulty with reasoning, problem-solving, and language.
2. **Behavioral Changes**: Agitation, apathy, depression, anxiety, or paranoia.
3. **Motor Symptoms (in certain types)**: Parkinsonism, muscle rigidity, and tremors.

### Signs
1. **Memory Loss**: Notable forgetfulness, especially recent events.
2. **Impaired Judgment**: Poor decision-making and inability to plan.
3. **Language Problems**: Difficulty finding the right words or understanding conversations.

### Diagnostic Tests
1. **Cognitive Assessments**: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
2. **Neuroimaging**: MRI, CT scans to detect brain atrophy, structural changes, or vascular abnormalities.
3. **PET Scans**: Used to visualize abnormal protein deposits (e. g., amyloid, tau).
4. **Blood tests:** check B12
5. **Urine dip/MS&C:** elderly patients can become very confused and forgetful with a bad UTI

### Management
1. **Pharmacotherapy**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil) for Alzheimer's; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's and some other dementias. Debated efficacy
2. **Symptomatic Treatment**: Address behavioural and psychological symptoms using appropriate medications.
3. **Non-Pharmacological Approaches**: Cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and occupational therapy.
   
### Complications/Red Flags
1. **Progressive Decline**: Steady deterioration of cognitive and functional abilities.
2. **Safety Concerns**: Increased risk of falls, wandering, and self-neglect. Inform the DVLA if deemed unsafe to drive.
3. **Caregiver Burnout**: Emotional and physical exhaustion of caregivers, requiring support and respite care.
