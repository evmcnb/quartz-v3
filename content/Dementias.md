| **Alzheimer's Disease**     | Amnesia, aphasia, agnosia, aprexia, associated behaviours (self neglect, personality changes, disinhibitions), steady decilne          | Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles in the brain                                | Age, family history, genetics, certain genes, head injuries, cardiovascular disease, diabetes                                    | Medications (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine) to slow progression, cognitive and behavioural therapies, lifestyle modifications (e.g., physical and mental activities, healthy diet, social engagement) |
| **Vascular Dementia**       | Problems with reasoning, planning, memory. Step wise decline as more microclots                                       | Reduced blood flow to the brain, often after a stroke or other cardiovascular issues | Hypertension, diabetes, smoking, high cholesterol, heart disease, stroke, transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), atrial fibrillation | Blood pressure management, cholesterol control, diabetes management, lifestyle changes (e.g., exercise, diet), cognitive rehabilitation                                          |
| **Lewy Body Dementia**      | Fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations + Parkinsonism (in Parkinson's Dementia, Parkinsonism first + primarily) | Lewy bodies (abnormal protein deposits), cognitive and motor symptoms                | Age, family history, Parkinson's disease, REM sleep behavior disorder                                                            | Medications for symptoms (e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors), physical therapy, occupational therapy, support for both the person and caregivers. No antipsychotics                   |
| **Frontotemporal Dementia** | Abrupt personality and behavior changes (loss of empathy, sexual disinhibition) language problems                     | Abnormal protein deposits in the frontal and temporal lobes                          | Genetic mutations (in some cases), family history                                                                                | Behavioral and symptom management, speech and language therapy, cognitive rehabilitation, supportive care                                                                        |


### Causes/Factors
1. **Alzheimer's Disease**: Abnormal protein accumulation (amyloid plaques, tau tangles) - slow progression
2. **Vascular Dementia**: Impaired blood flow to the brain due to stroke or other vascular issues.
3. **Lewy Body Dementia**: Presence of abnormal protein deposits (alpha-synuclein) in the brain.- often associated with [[Parkinson's disease]]. No anti-psychotics ^5b78b4
4. **Frontotemporal Dementia**: Degeneration of frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.

#### Pseudodementias

Mimic the symptoms of dementia
- Wernicke-korsakoff syndrome 
- B12/folate deficiency
- Depression
- Hypothyroid

### Symptoms
1. **Cognitive Decline**: Memory loss, difficulty with reasoning, problem-solving, and language.
2. **Behavioral Changes**: Agitation, apathy, depression, anxiety, or paranoia.
3. **Motor Symptoms (in certain types)**: Parkinsonism, muscle rigidity, and tremors.

### Signs
1. **Memory Loss**: Notable forgetfulness, especially recent events.
2. **Impaired Judgment**: Poor decision-making and inability to plan.
3. **Language Problems**: Difficulty finding the right words or understanding conversations.

### Diagnostic Tests
1. **Cognitive Assessments**: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
2. **Neuroimaging**: MRI, CT scans to detect brain atrophy, structural changes, or vascular abnormalities.
3. **PET Scans**: Used to visualize abnormal protein deposits (e. g., amyloid, tau).
4. **Blood tests:** check B12
5. **Urine dip/MS&C:** elderly patients can become very confused and forgetful with a bad UTI

### Management
1. **Pharmacotherapy**: Cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil) for Alzheimer's; memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's and some other dementias. Debated efficacy
2. **Symptomatic Treatment**: Address behavioural and psychological symptoms using appropriate medications.
3. **Non-Pharmacological Approaches**: Cognitive stimulation, physical exercise, and occupational therapy.
   
### Complications/Red Flags
1. **Progressive Decline**: Steady deterioration of cognitive and functional abilities.
2. **Safety Concerns**: Increased risk of falls, wandering, and self-neglect. Inform the DVLA if deemed unsafe to drive.
3. **Caregiver Burnout**: Emotional and physical exhaustion of caregivers, requiring support and respite care.

##### BPSD
Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia - can be detained under the MHA 

Looks normal - physical function retained but personality changes

**Behavioural**
- Agitation 
- Aggression 
- Restlessness
- Wandering

**Psychological**
- Hallucinations
- Delusion
- Depression
- Anxiety
