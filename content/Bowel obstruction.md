Small bowel obstruction is more common

Results in a build up gas and faecal matter proximal to the obstruction - back pressure

Rest of GI tract secretes fluid that is later absorbed in colon. When there is an obstruction fluid loss from this leads to hypovolaemia and shock. 

## Causes/Factors

| **Common** | **Rare** |
| ---- | ---- |
| *Hernias* *(small bowel) | Strictures (Crohn's disease) |
| *Adhesions* *(small bowel - past surgery) | Intussusception (in young children) |
| *Malignancy* *(large bowel) | Volvulus (large bowel) |
| Constipation | Gallstone ileus  |

### Closed-loop obstruction

- Two points of obstruction in the bowel
- Middle section sandwiched between two points

Might occur with: 
- Adhesions
- Hernias
- Volvulus
- A single point of obstruction but with a ileocaecal valve that is competent 
## Presentation

- Vomiting (particularly green bilious)
- Abdo distension
- Diffuse abdo pain
- Absolute constipation and lack of flactulence
- "Tinkling" bowel sounds may be heard in early obstruction

## Investigations

- Abdo XR
	- Large bowel touch the peripheries and have lines that **do not** go completely across the bowel (haustra)
	- Small bowel usually don't extend to the peripheries but have lines that **do** extend the full length (valvulae conniventes)
- Erect chest XR - to check for pneumoperitoneum (bowel perforation)

## Management

ABCDE approach - may be haemodynamically unstable and require urgent intervention if develop:
- hypovolaemic shock 
- Bowel ischaemia 
- Bowel perforation
- Sepsis 

Full set of bloods: 
- U&E 
- Metabolic acidosis due to vomiting (VBG)
- Raised lactate due to bowel ischaemia (VBG)

"Drip and suck" management
- Nil by mouth
- IV fluids - to rehydrate and correct electrolyte imbalances
- NG tube with free drainage to allow stomach contents freely drain and reduce risk of vomiting and aspiration 


### Surgical intervention 

Conservative management may be used in first instance in stable patients with obstruction secondary to adhesions or volvulus.

The definitive management is surgery - 
- Exploratory surgery - if unclear cause
- Adhesiolysis to treat adhesions 
- Hernia repair 
- Emergency resection of obstructing tumour

Stents may be inserted during a colonoscopy in obstruction due to a tumour
