**Difference between nephritic and [[Nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]] syndrome**
- haematuria in nephritic
- proteinuria in [[Nephrotic syndrome|nephrotic]]

## Causes/Factors

- **Infections:** Certain bacterial infections, such as streptococcal infections, can trigger immune responses that affect the glomeruli.
- **Autoimmune Diseases:** Conditions like lupus and vasculitis can cause glomerular inflammation.
- **Hereditary Factors:** Some forms of nephritic syndrome have a genetic component.

## Symptoms

- **Hematuria:** Blood in the urine, giving it a pink or brown color.
- **Only mild proteinuria** 
- **Oedema** 
- **[[Essential hypertension|Hypertension]]** 
- **Reduced urine output:** renal failure

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Urinalysis:** Detects blood, protein, and other abnormalities in the urine.
- **Blood Tests:** To assess kidney function, levels of waste products, and signs of inflammation.
- **Kidney Biopsy:** Removal and examination of a small kidney tissue sample to determine the cause and extent of glomerular inflammation.

## Management

1. **Addressing Underlying Conditions** 
2. **Blood Pressure Control:** Medications to manage hypertension and protect the kidneys.
3. **Diuretics:** To manage edema.
4. **Dietary Changes:** Reducing salt and fluid intake.
5. **Immunosuppressive Medications:** In cases of autoimmune-related nephritic syndrome.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Progression to Chronic Kidney Disease:** Severe and prolonged inflammation can lead to kidney damage.
- **Secondary Infections:** Weakened immune system can lead to other infections.
- **Hypertensive Crisis:** Severe hypertension requiring immediate medical attention.
