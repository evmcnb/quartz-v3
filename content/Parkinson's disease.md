- Lack of dopamine
- Symptoms begin when 80% of dopamine producing cells (substantia nigra) have died

**Parkinsonism** is anything that brings about these symptoms.
**Parkinson's** is the progressive disease - most common cause of Parkinsonism


## Causes/Factors

- FH
- Male
- Head injury
- Pesticide exposure (maybe)

- Drug induced (anti-psychotic drugs) - reduce dopamine e.g. risperidone, haloperidol, metoclopramide promethazine, prochlorperazine

**Decrease risk**
- Smoking
- Coffee 
- NSAIDs
- Estrogen replacement

## Symptoms

- Depression
- Parkinson's Dementia (Lewy Body)
- Micrographia
- Sleep disorders - REM sleep disturbance, presents up to 30 years before Parkinson's 
- Postural hypotension
- Urinary problems

- Loss of smell
- Hypersalivation

## Signs

TRAP features

- Tremor - pill rolling tremor - resting
- Rigidity
- Akinesia/bradykinesia - reduced blink, face expression, soft voice, shuffling steps, reduced arm swing. Trouble getting out of chair
- Postural changes (imbalance, falls)

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosis of exclusion - clinical diagnosis so just need to rule out other causes
- MRI
- Blood tests
- No specific medical test
- Referral to movement clinical before medicating 

## Management

If too much dopamine is replaced, can cause frontal changes in patients. Need to be given at a specific time of day every day. Sudden withdrawal can cause life threatening symptoms.

- Levadopa - precursor of dopamine that passes through the BBB + peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor (Carbidopa). Reduces peripheral side effects by stopping its breakdown into dopamine
- Dopamine 
- MAO-B inhibitors
- Amantadine
- COMT inhibitors

Pallidotomy (outdated) - probe inserted into globus pallidus and frozen to eliminate dyskinesia 

Deep brain stimulation - electrodes placed in important areas of the brain and pulses are generated from a device under the skin in chest 
## Complications/red Flags
The resting tremor may take longer than the other symptoms to improve after medicating
