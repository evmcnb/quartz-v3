Vasovagal Syncope is a common cause of fainting (syncope) characterised by a sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure, leading to a temporary loss of consciousness. 

It is often triggered by a strong emotional or physical response that stimulates the vagus nerve, resulting in a reflex response that causes the heart to slow down and blood vessels to dilate, leading to a sudden drop in blood pressure.

> [!Info] Vasovagal Syncope
> Quite common but important to distinguish from more sinister reasons for the collapse
> History from a observer is invaluable for diagnosis
>
> It cannot be vasovagal if it occurs when lying down
> 
> Onset is over a few seconds - not instantaneous. Often with pre-syncopal symptoms - nausea, vomiting, sweating
> 
> Urinary incontinence is uncommon and there is no tongue biting
> 
> LoC usually lasts for around 2 mins


## Causes/Factors

The primary causes and triggers for Vasovagal Syncope include:

- **Emotional Stress:** Anxiety, fear, or emotional distress.
- **Pain:** Severe pain or the sight of blood.
- **Prolonged Standing:** Especially in warm or crowded environments.
- **Dehydration:** Inadequate fluid intake.
- **Heat Exposure:** Especially in hot environments.
- **Straining:** Due to activities like coughing, sneezing, or bowel movements.

## Symptoms & Signs

Symptoms of Vasovagal Syncope can include:

- Decreased pulse
- Dilated pupils - blurred vision
- Sweating
- Lightheaded 
- Brief limb jerks may occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion - but there is no tonic/clonic sequence

## Diagnostic tests

- **Tilt Table Test:** To induce fainting under controlled conditions.
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG):** To record the heart's electrical activity.
- **Blood Pressure Monitoring:** To assess changes in blood pressure.
- **Holter Monitor:** Continuous monitoring of heart activity over a period.


## Management

1. **Avoiding Triggers:** Identifying and avoiding specific triggers.
2. **Hydration:** Ensuring an adequate intake of fluids.
3. **Physical Counter-pressure Manoeuvres:** Such as tensing leg muscles or crossing legs to prevent fainting.
4. **Medications:** In some cases, medications that increase blood volume or constrict blood vessels may be prescribed.
5. **Tilt Training:** A supervised exercise program to improve tolerance to standing.
