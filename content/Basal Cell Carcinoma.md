## Causes/Factors
The primary cause is prolonged **exposure to ultraviolet (UV)** radiation from the **sun** or **tanning beds**. Other risk factors include:

- Fair Skin: Light-skinned individuals are more susceptible.
- Chronic Sun Exposure: Especially without adequate sun protection.
- History of Skin Cancer: Previous BCCs or other skin cancers increase the risk.
- Immunosuppression: Weakened immune system due to conditions or medications.
- Age: BCC is more common in older adults.

## Symptoms

- **Nodular BCC:** typically a pearly nodule with rolled edge on face or sun-exposed site. May have a central ulcer
- **Superficial BCC**: lesions appear as red scaly plaques with raised smooth edge. Often on trunk or shoulders. 

## Diagnostic Tests

- Referral to a dermatologist for input
- Skin biopsy 

## Management

- Excision
- Cryotherapy
- For **topical BCC**: flurouracil (efudex) or imiquimod 

## Complications/red Flags

- **Local Tissue Destruction:** If left untreated, BCC can invade surrounding tissues and structures.
- **Disfigurement:** Lesions on the face can cause disfigurement if not properly treated.
- **Recurrence:** BCCs may recur, especially if not completely removed.
