An infection in the eyelid tissues **anterior to the orbital septum**

Much more common and less serious than [[Orbital cellulitis]]
## Causes/Factors

- Superficial injury (eg insect bite, [[Eyelid Disorders#Chalazion|chalazion]], [[Conjunctivitis]])
- Can be secondary to URTI or sinusitis

## Clinical Features

Must exclude orbital cellulitis and red flag features
- Eyelid redness, mild tenderness and swelling
- Fever
- Systemically well, no pain on eye movement. No visual changes

|               | Peri-orbital cellulitis | Orbital cellulitis |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| Proptosis     | No                      | Yes                |
| Eye movements | Normal                  | Painful/restricted |
| Visual acuity | Normal                  | May be reduced     |
| Colour vision | Normal                  | May be reduced     |
| RAPD (different light reflex)              | No                        | Yes in severe cases                   |

## Diagnostic Tests

There are no specific investigations but if there is any suspicion of orbital cellulitis or unclear diagnosis, refer to secondary care for CT head

## Management

Emergency referral to ophthalmology/ENT if:
- there is any suspicion of orbital cellulitis 
- the patient is systemically unwell
- the patient is a child as paediatric patients require empirical IV antibiotics and daily monitoring due to the difficulty in differentiating between the two - can be challenging history and exam to take

For adult patients oral co-amoxiclav is 1st line (clindamycin if pen allergic)
Consider 24-48h follow up and safety netting advice should be given 

## Complications/red Flags

- Peri-orbital cellulitis can **spread** to cause orbital cellulitis. Important to provide adequate safety netting advice to patients
