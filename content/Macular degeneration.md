Lots of different classifications for age related macular degeneration (AMD)

**Early AMD** - with low, medium or high risk of progression. Usually not a/w visual disturbances 
**Late AMD**: 
- Intermediate - large drusen $\pm$ pigment changes
- Wet active - presence of choroidal neovascuarisation 
- Wet inactive - presence of scar tissue or regressed neovascularisation 
- Dry AMD - well defined areas of atrophy of retinal pigment epithelium


## Causes/Factors

- Most commonly age-related - in people aged 50 and over 
- Can also be due to [[Diabetes Mellitus]], [[Nutritional disorders]], and genetics 

## Symptoms

- Distortion of vision, where straight lines appear crooked or wavy.
- Painless loss, or blurring, of central or near-central vision.
- A black or grey patch affecting the central field of vision (scotoma).
- Difficulty reading, driving, or seeing fine detail (such as facial features). 
- Flickering or flashing lights (photopsia). 
- Difficulty adjusting from bright to dim lighting.
- Visual hallucinations (associated with severe visual loss).
- Visual distortions - straight lines may appear wavy or bent

## Signs
- Drusen - collections of lipid material that accumulate beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and within Brunch's membrane

- Retinal pigment epithelial changes 
- Geographic atrophy
- Choroidal neovascularisation - abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina in wet macular degeneration 
## Investigations

- Retinal exam - dilated fundus exam
- Optical coherence tomography (OCT) high resolution imaging to assess retinal thickness and integrity 
- Fluorescein angiography - to detect choroidal neovasculatisation in wet macular degeneration

## Management

- If AMD is suspected, urgent referral to an ophthalmologist should be arranged within a week as treatment for neovascular AMD should be started promptly to preserve sight. 
- Management in secondary care includes intraocular injections of anti-angiogenic drugs for neovascular AMD.

## Complications/red Flags

- Visual impairment and blindness. 
- Visual hallucinations.
- Depression.
- Falls and fractures.
- Reduced quality of life
