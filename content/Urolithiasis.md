Urinary tract calculi/stones

Stones forming in the lumen of the urinary tract, anywhere from renal calyx $\rightarrow$ bladder. Types:

- Calcium 70% - raised calcium
- Urate 5% - raised urate, gout etc
- Cystine 1% - raised cystine eg congenital cystinuria
- Struvite 15% - raised pH of urine so magnesium ammonium phosphate salts precipitate out

## Causes/Factors

- Raised associated mineral

  - Hypercalcaemia eg parathyroid adenoma
  - Raised urate eg [[gout]]

- Dehydration
- Stagnant urine

Leads to soluble material to precipitate out

## Clinical Features

Pain - excruciating 

- URETER: Classic "loin to groin" pain - renal colic
- BLADDER: lower abdo pain
- URETHRA: dysuria

- Haematuria
- Reduced UO
- 

## Diagnostic Tests

- Urine dip - haematria + look for infection
- U&Es - kidney function, calcium levels
- USS/CT - negative ultrasound does not exclude diagnosis

## Management

##### Symptoms
Opiates not effective
- NSAIDs - diclofenac - IM or rectal
- IV paracetamol if NSAIDs contraindicated
- Anti-emetics - metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, cyclizine
- Antibiotics if infected 

##### Stone
Watch and wait approach if less than 5mm in diameter as there is a 50-80% chance of these passing on their own. May also be appropriate to wait for 5-10mm depending on other factors.

- $\alpha$-blocker **tamsulosin** can facilitate spontaneous stone passage during the waiting period. Only for stones less than 10mm
- Surgical intervention for large stones or stones that do not pass on their own. Also indicated in cases of complete obstruction and infection 
	- Shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) - break up stone to pass
	- Ureteroscopy + laser lithotripsy
	- Percutaneous nephrolithotomy - under GA

##### To prevent recurrence
- 2.5-3L of water a day
- Lemon juice in water - citric acid binds to urinary calcium
- Avoid carbonated drinks - phosphoric acid promotes calcium oxalate formation
- Reduce salt intake
- Maintain normal calcium intake - too low intake can also increase risk

- Potassium citrate + thiazide diuretics for patients with recurrent calcium stones 
## Complications/red Flags

- Infections
