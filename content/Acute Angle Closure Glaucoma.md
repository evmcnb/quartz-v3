### Causes/Factors

- **Anatomical variance** - people with narrow drainage angles in their eye are more predisposed 
- **Age and gender** - more common in old age and females
- **Hyperopia** (farsightedness) - shallower anterior chamber making them more susceptible
- **Cataracts** - increased risk 
- **Medications**:
	- **_Adrenergic medications_** (e.g., **_noradrenaline_**)
	- **_Anticholinergic medications_** (e.g., **_oxybutynin_** and **_solifenacin_**)
	- **_Tricyclic antidepressants_** (e.g., **_amitriptyline_**), which have anticholinergic effects
- **Pupil dilation** - medications or conditions that can cause pupil dilation can contribute to the development of acute glaucoma. 

## Clinical Features

**Short history of:**
- Severely painful red eye
- Blurred vision
- Halos around lights
- Associated headache nausea and vomiting 

## Investigations

Clinical examination:
- **_Red eye_**
- **_Hazy cornea_**
- **_Decreased visual acuity_**
- **_Mid-dilated_** pupil
- **_Fixed-size_** pupil
- **_Hard eyeball_** on gentle palpation

## Management

**Acute**
- Lying the patient on their back without a pillow 
- ***Pilocarpine*** eye drops (2% for blue and 4% for brown eyes) (dilates pupils)
- **_Acetazolamide_** 500 mg orally (reduction in aqueous humour) 
- Analgesia and an antiemetic, if required

**Secondary Care**
- **_Pilocarpine_** eye drops
- **_Acetazolamide_** (oral or intravenous)
- **_Hyperosmotic agents_** (e.g., **_intravenous mannitol_**) increase the **_osmotic gradient_** between the blood and the eye
- **_Timolol_** is a **_beta blocker_** that reduces the production of aqueous humour
- **_Dorzolamide_** is a **_carbonic anhydrase inhibitor_** that reduces the production of aqueous humour
- **_Brimonidine_** is a **_sympathomimetics_** that reduces aqueous humour production and increases uveoscleral outflow

### Laser iridotomy

- Definitive treatment 
- Making a hole in the iris using a laser
- Allows the aqueous humour to follow directly from the posterior camber to anterior chamber


## Complications/red Flags

- Irreversible loss of vision
