Aortic aneurysm is a localized, abnormal dilation of the aortic wall.
Approx. 90% mortality if ruptures while not in surgery. 
Two main types: Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) and Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA).
  
## Causes/Factors
- **Atherosclerosis**: Common cause, leading to weakening of the arterial wall.
- **Genetic Factors**: Family history of aortic aneurysms.
- **Hypertension**: Prolonged high blood pressure contributing to aortic wall stress.
- **Connective Tissue Disorders**: Conditions like [[Marfan syndrome]].

## Symptoms
- **Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA)**:
  - Often asymptomatic.
  - Abdominal or back pain.
  - Pulsatile abdominal mass.
- **Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm (TAA)**:
  - Chest or back pain.
  - Shortness of breath.
  - Hoarseness or difficulty swallowing.

## Signs
- **AAA**:
  - Pulsatile mass on abdominal examination.
  - Bruit over the aneurysm.
  - Often ruptures
- **TAA**:
  - Widened mediastinum on chest X-ray.
  - Murmurs or abnormal heart sounds.
  - Often dissects

## Diagnostic Tests
- **Ultrasound**: Common for AAA detection.
- **CT Angiography**: Provides detailed imaging of the aorta.
- **MRI**: Especially useful for TAA assessment.

## Management
- **Monitoring**: Regular imaging to track aneurysm size.
- **Medication**: Beta-blockers to reduce blood pressure and stress on the aneurysm.
- **Surgery**: Repair or replacement of the weakened aortic segment, particularly for larger aneurysms.

## Complications/Red Flags
- **Rupture**: Sudden, severe pain, hypotension, and shock.
- **Dissection**: Tear in the aortic wall, leading to life-threatening complications.
- **Thrombosis**: Formation of blood clots within the aneurysm.
