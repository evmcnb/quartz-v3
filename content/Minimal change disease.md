Minimal Change Disease (MCD) is a type of kidney disorder characterised by damage to the glomeruli. No change on histology under light microscopy 

## Causes/Factors

Possible autoimmune condition where T cells release substances that damage the glomerular filtration barrier leading to increase protein in urine.
- Child
- NSAID

## Symptoms

- [[Nephrotic syndrome#Symptoms|Nephrotic syndrome]]
- normal eGFR

## Signs

- **Edema:** Swelling in various body parts due to fluid retention.
- **Foamy Urine:** Due to excess protein in the urine.
- **Pallor:** Pale appearance due to low albumin levels.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Urinalysis:** Detects proteinuria and other abnormalities in the urine.
- **Blood Tests:** To assess kidney function, protein levels, and lipid levels.
- **Kidney Biopsy:** A definitive diagnosis often requires a kidney tissue sample, which shows minimal changes under the microscope.

## Management

1. **Corticosteroids:** Prednisone or other steroids to suppress the abnormal immune response.
2. **Immunosuppressive Drugs:** For cases not responding to steroids.
3. **Diuretics:** To manage edema.
4. **Dietary Changes:** Reducing salt and fluid intake.

## Complications/red Flags

- **Risk of Infection:** Immunosuppressive medications can increase susceptibility to infections.
- **Thrombosis:** Increased risk of blood clots due to hyperlipidemia.
- **Relapses:** MCD can recur after periods of remission.
