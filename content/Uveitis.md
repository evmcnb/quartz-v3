> [!info] Classification and terms
> Anterior uveitis (iritis) - involves inflammation of the iris and adjacent structures within the anterior chamber
>
> Intermediate uveitis - inflammation affecting the ciliary body and vitreous humour
>
> Posterior uveitis - inflammation of the choroid, retina and optic nerve head
> 
> Panuveitis - inflammation of the entire uvea

**Iritis** - specifically refers to the inflammation of the iris and adjacent structures within the eye's anterior chamber which is a subtype of uveitis

**Uveitis** -  a broader term that encompasses inflammation of the uvea. This includes the iris, but also the ciliary body and choroid.

## Causes/Factors

- Usually idiopathic
- Autoimmune - [[Inflammatory Arthritis#Rheumatoid Arthritis|RA]], [[Ankylosing spondylitis]] and [[inflammatory bowel disease]]
- Infections
- Trauma

## Symptoms 

- Eye pain
- Redness
- Blurred vision
- Photophobia

## Signs

**Anterior**
- Miosis - pupil constriction due to inflammation
- Hypopyon - accumulation of white blood cells in the anterior chamber

**Intermediate**
- Vitreous cells and haze
- Snow-banking - peripheral snowflake-like exudates on the retina

**Posterior**
- Chorioretinal lesions 
- Optic disc swelling 

## Investigations

- **Physical Exam** - assess for evidence of facial trauma, exam eyelids, conjunctiva and tarsal surface. Check visual acuity. 
- **Slit-Lamp Examination**: Detailed evaluation of the anterior segment and fundus to assess inflammation and associated complications.
- **Laboratory Tests**: Blood tests for autoimmune markers, infectious serologies, and inflammatory markers.
- **Imaging**: Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography, and ultrasonography for detailed assessment of ocular structures.

## Management

If severe eye pain and a significant reduction in vision is present the person should be referred immediately for same day assessment by ophthalmology

- For non-infectious uveitis, oral or topical corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation
	- A cycloplegic-mydriatic drug (1% cyclopentolate) is also given to paralyse the ciliary body
- For infectious uveitits an appropriate antimicrobial should be given in addition to the above

In severe or chronic cases, immunosuppressive drugs, TNFi, laser phototherapy, cryotherapy may also be considered. 

## Complications/red Flags

> [!danger] Potentially blinding condition
> Accounts f or up to 25% of cases of legal blindness in the developing world and 5-10% of visual impairment worldwide

- **Secondary Glaucoma**: Increased intraocular pressure due to inflammation or synechiae.
- **Cataract Formation**: Due to chronic inflammation and corticosteroid use.
- **Retinal Complications**: Including macular edema, epiretinal membrane, and retinal detachment.
- **Vision Loss**: Severe or chronic inflammation leading to irreversible visual impairment.
