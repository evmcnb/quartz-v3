Most common form of breast cancer in the UK - around 1 in 8 lifetime risk for women (1% of UK cases are male)

## Types

**Non-invasive ductal carcinoma *in situ* (DCIS)**
- Pre-malignant cancer of epithelial cells of breast ducts
- Localised to a single area
- Often picked up by mammogram screening
- Potential to spread locally over years
- 30% become invasive
- Good prognosis if excised and adjuvant treatment 

**Lobular carcinoma *in situ* (LCIS)**
- Pre-malignant  typically in pre-menopausal women 
- Rarer and tends to be multifocal
- Increased risk of invasive breast cancer in the future (~30%)
- Often managed conservatively with monitoring (6 monthly exam and yearly mammogram)

**Invasive ductal carcinoma - NST**
- Most common invasive carcinoma (80%)
- NST - means no specific type and its not specifically classified (eg medullary or mucinous)
- Originate in cells from the breast ducts
- Can be seen on mammograms

**Invasive lobular carcinomas**
- Around 15% of invasive breast cancers
- Originate in cells from the breast lobules
- Not always visible on mammograms

**Inflammatory breast cancer**
- 1-3% of carcinomas
- Presents similarly to a breast abscess or mastitis
- Swollen, warm, tender breast with pitting skin (peau d'orange)
- Does not respond to antibiotics
- Worse prognosis than other breast cancers 

**Paget’s Disease of the Nipple**

- Looks like eczema of the nipple/areolar
- Erythematous, scaly rash
- Indicates breast cancer involving the nipple
- May represent DCIS or invasive breast cancer
- Requires biopsy, staging and treatment, as with any other invasive breast cancer

**Rarer Types of Breast Cancer**

- Medullary breast cancer
- Mucinous breast cancer
- Tubular breast cancer
- Multiple others
## Causes/Factors

- Family history - first degree (BRCA1/2 gene)
	- BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17
		- Around 70% will develop breast cancer by 80
		- Around 50% will develop ovarian cancer
		- Also increased risk of bowel and prostate
	- BRCA2 gene on chromosome 13
		- Around 60% will develop breast cancer by aged 80
		- Around 20% will develop ovarian cancer 
- Increased oestrogen exposure (earlier onset of periods and later menopause; nulliparity; 1st pregnancy 30>yrs old)
- More dense breast tissue - more glandular tissue
- Obesity
- Smoking

## Presentation

- Lumps that are hard, irregular, painless or fixed in place
- Lumps may be tethered to the skin or the chest wall
- Nipple retraction
- Skin dimpling or oedema (peau d’orange)
- Lymphadenopathy, particularly in the axilla

> [!todo] Referral Criteria
> Two week wait referral for:
> - Unexplained breast lump in patients aged 30 or above
> - Unilateral nipple changes in patients aged over 50 or above
> - Unexplained lump in the axilla in patients aged 30 or above
> - Skin changes suggestive of breast cancer

## Investigations

> [!abstract] Triple assessment
> - **_Clinical assessment_** (history and examination)
>- **_Imaging_** (ultrasound or mammography)
>- **_Biopsy_** (fine needle aspiration or core biopsy)

- **_Ultrasound scans_** are typically used to assess lumps in younger women - distinguish solid lumps from cystic fluid
- **_Mammograms_** are generally more effective in older women - can find calcifications
- ***MRI*** for screening women in higher risk groups or to further assess the size and features of a tumour

- **_Sentinel lymph node biopsy_** may be used during breast cancer surgery where the initial ultrasound does not show any abnormal nodes. 
	- Contrast in injected into the tumour area and travels through the lymphatics to the first lymph node - sentinel. 

- Cancer histology - may have receptors:
	- Oestrogen receptors (ER)
	- Progesterone receptors (PR)
	- Human epidermal growth factor (HER2)
**_Triple-negative breast cancer_** is where the breast cancer cells do not express any of these three receptors. This carries a worse prognosis, as it limits the treatment options for targeting the cancer.

> [!success] Breast cancer screening
> 
> The NHS breast cancer screening program offers a **_mammogram_** every **3 years** to women aged **50 – 70 years**.
> 
> Screening aims to detect breast cancer early, which improves outcomes. Roughly 1 in 100 women are diagnosed with breast cancer after going for a mammogram.

### High risk patients
There are different recommendations for screening patients with a higher risk.
- Genetic counselling 
- Annual mammogram
- Chemoprevention 
	- Tamoxifen (ER modulator) if premenopausal
	- Anastrozole (prevents conversion of androgens to oestrogen) if post (except with severe osteoporosis)

## Management

TNM staging: 
![[z_attachments/Pasted image 20240220153923.png|550]]

All patients are discussed with the **_multidisciplinary team_** (**_MDT_**) for treatment planning

**Surgery**
- Tumour removal
- Axillary clearance 
- Reconstructive - immediate or delayed. Can be partial or reduce and reshape both breasts to match

**Radiotherapy**

**Chemotherapy**
- **_Neoadjuvant therapy_** – intended to shrink the tumour before surgery
- **_Adjuvant chemotherapy_** – given after surgery to reduce recurrence
- **_Treatment_** of metastatic or recurrent breast cancer

**Drug treatment**
- Tamoxifen for premenopausal 
- Aromatase inhibitors for post 

ER positive
- Fulvestrant (selective ER down regulator )
- GnRH (Gonadotropin releasing hormone)

HER2 positive
- Herceptin (*trastuzumab*) - monoclonal antibody targets HER2 receptor. Can also affect heart function so initial heart monitoring is required
- Perjeta (*pertuzumab*) for HER2 receptor can be used in combination with herceptin
- Nerlynx (*neratinib*) - tryosine kinase inhibitor reducing the growth of breast cancers

## Complications/red Flags

Metastasis
- **L**ungs
- **L**iver
- **B**ones
- **B**rain

Chronic lymphoedema = impaired drainage in that area

> [!warning] Cannulas and bloods
> Avoid taking blood or putting a cannula in the arm on the side of previous breast cancer surgery. Higher risk of complications and infections due to the impaired lymphatic drainage on that side
