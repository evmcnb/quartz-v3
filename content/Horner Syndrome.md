Also known as oculosympathetic palsy, is a neurological condition characterized by a set of symptoms resulting from disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway that controls certain involuntary functions of the eye and face. This disruption can be caused by various underlying medical conditions affecting the sympathetic nervous system.

## Causes/Factors

Horner Syndrome results from interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the brain and the eye. This interruption can occur due to several causes:

1. **Central Causes:** Lesions or damage to the central nervous system, often within the brainstem or spinal cord.
2. **Preganglionic Causes:** Interruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the spinal cord and the superior cervical ganglion.
3. **Postganglionic Causes:** Disruption of the sympathetic nerve pathway between the superior cervical ganglion and the eye.
4. **Congenital Causes:** Some individuals are born with Horner Syndrome due to developmental issues in the sympathetic nerve pathway.

## Symptoms

Horner Syndrome primarily affects one side of the face and eye, resulting in the following set of characteristic symptoms:

- **Ptosis:** Drooping of the upper eyelid on the affected side.
- **Miosis:** Constricted pupil in the affected eye.
- **Anhidrosis:** Decreased sweating on the affected side of the face.

## Signs

- **Ptosis:** The drooping of the upper eyelid may be subtle or pronounced.
- **Miosis:** The affected pupil is noticeably smaller than the unaffected pupil.
- **Anhidrosis:** The skin on the affected side of the face may appear dry due to reduced sweating.

## Diagnostic Tests

To diagnose Horner Syndrome and identify the underlying cause, healthcare professionals may perform various tests, including:

- **Imaging:** MRI or CT scans to identify lesions or abnormalities in the central or sympathetic nervous system.
- **Underlying Cause Investigation:** Determining the root cause of Horner Syndrome through medical history, physical examination, and additional tests.

## Management

The management of Horner Syndrome involves addressing the underlying cause, which may vary depending on the specific case. If Horner Syndrome is caused by an identifiable condition, treatment will be aimed at managing or treating that condition. For cases with no apparent underlying cause, close monitoring may be recommended to detect any potential changes or developments.

## Complications/Red Flags

Horner Syndrome itself is a set of symptoms indicating disruption of the sympathetic nervous system. The most important aspect is identifying and addressing the underlying cause, as this could be indicative of a more serious medical condition such as:

- **Brainstem Lesions:** Horner Syndrome can be a sign of a lesion or injury in the brainstem.
- **Carcinomas:** Tumours, particularly in the chest or neck, can disrupt sympathetic pathways.
- **Aneurysms:** An aneurysm affecting blood vessels can lead to Horner Syndrome.
- **Pancoast Tumours:** Tumours located at the top of the lungs can cause Horner Syndrome.
