Cellulitis is a common bacterial skin infection that affects the deeper layers of the skin and the subcutaneous tissues. It typically occurs when bacteria enter the skin through a break or crack, causing redness, swelling, and pain. Cellulitis can occur anywhere on the body and may spread rapidly if left untreated.

Ludwig's angina - cellulitis of the submandibular space (often after dental procedures)

## Causes/Factors

Most common bacteria - *Strep. pyogenes* and *Staph. aureus* 
- **Skin Injuries:** Cuts, wounds, insect bites, or surgical incisions.
- **Skin Conditions:** [[Atopic dermatitis (eczema)]], dermatitis, or other pre-existing skin disorders.
- **Weakened Immune System:** Conditions like [[Diabetes Mellitus]] or immunodeficiency.
- **Lymphedema:** Swelling that impairs the normal flow of lymph.

## Symptoms

- **Demarcation:** Well-defined borders between affected and unaffected skin.
- **Systemic Symptoms:** Fever and generalized malaise.
- **Lymphangitis:** Red streaks indicating spread along lymph vessels.

## Signs

- Calor, dolor, rubor, tumor (heat, tenderness, erythema, swelling)
- **Fever and Chills:** if septic 
- **Skin Lesions:** Blistering or oozing of clear fluid.

## Diagnostic Tests

Diagnosing Cellulitis is primarily based on clinical evaluation, but additional tests may be used to exclude a [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]]:
- FBC, CRP and possible imaging

## Management

- Elevate affected limb
- Antibiotics (PO/IV dependant on severity) - commonly amoxicillin / ben pen + flucloxacillin. If penicillin allergic - clindamycin and ceftriaxone. 10 day course PO but up to 14 days IV if systemic. 
 
## Complications/red Flags

- Septicaemia
- Abscess formation
- Recurrence
- Chronic skin discolouration
