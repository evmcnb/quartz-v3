Acute and fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness

Need to differentiate from [[Dementias]]

|                     | Delirium               | Dementia                     |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Onset               | Acute                  | Insidious                    |
| Course              | Fluctuating            | Progressive                  |
| Duration            | Days to weeks          | Months to years              |
| Consciousness       | Impaired               | Usually alert                |
| Attention           | Impaired               | Normal and then impaired     |
| Psychomotor changes | Increased or decreased | Often normal                 |
| Hallucinations      | Common                 | Less common (type dependant) |
| Reversibility       | Usually reversible     | Progressive                  |

Collateral history may be very useful - if patient has capacity patient needs to consent for the collateral history to be taken.
Assessment of capacity is important 

### Types

- **Hyperactive delirium** - predominantly restless and agitated. Often occurs during night time
- **Hypoactive delirium** - inactive and sleepy. During the day often

## Causes/Factors

**P**ain
**I**nfection - [[Urinary Tract Infection]], [[pneumonia]], [[Cellulitis]], [[Skin Ulcers]]
**N**utrition - B12, folate, glucose, [[Nutritional disorders]]
**C**onstipation - +/- urinary retention, codiene
**H**ydration - intake, diruetics, diarrhoea


**M**edication - prescribed, alcohol and drugs, withdrawal
**E**nvironment/electrolytes

## Symptoms

- **Disturbed Consciousness**: Reduced clarity, orientation, and awareness.
- **Cognitive Dysfunction**: Impaired memory, disorientation, and confusion.
- **Fluctuating Alertness**: Symptoms vary throughout the day.

## Signs

- **Inattention**: Difficulty focusing or sustaining attention.
- **Altered Perception**: Hallucinations or misinterpretation of stimuli.
- **Disorganized Thinking**: Incoherent speech, illogical thoughts.

## Social History

- Who do they live with?
- Alchol, drugs, work
- House - stairs?
- Daily tasks of living - wash, dress
- Shopping?

## Investigations

- **Observations**: full set of obs, ECG, urine dip, glucose
- **Cognitive Assessment**:
	- 4AT - Alertness, Cognition, Attention, Acute changes or fluctuating course
	- MoCA - 


- **Blood Tests**: FBC, U&Es, TFTs, LFTs, HbA1C, Coag screen, Bone profile, Folate & B12, vitamin D
- **Imaging**: CXR for pneumonia, CT head to rule out bleeds, bladder USS 

## Management

- **Address Underlying Cause**: Treat the root medical condition or discontinue offending medications.
- **Environmental Support**: Maintain a quiet, well-lit environment to reduce confusion.
- **Challenging Behaviour**: Frustration is natural if you cannot effectively communicate needs. Medication is an option as a last resort after communication tactics have failed. 
- **Communication**: Always try to *redirect* patients rather than decieve etc. 

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Longer stay in hosptial**: more hosptial aquired complications 
- **Increased Morbidity and Mortality**: Delirium is often a sign of severe illness and have a 2x mortality risk than a normal patient 
- **Risk of Falls and Injuries**: Altered mental status poses safety risks.
- **Potential for Long-Term Cognitive Impairment**: Especially in older adults, delirium can contribute to persistent cognitive decline.
