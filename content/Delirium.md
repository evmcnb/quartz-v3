Acute and fluctuating disturbance in attention and awareness

Need to differentiate from [[Dementias]]

|       | Delirium | Dementia | 
| ----- | -------- | -------- |
| Onset | Acute			| Insidious |
| Course | Fluctuating | Progressive |
| Duration | Days to weeks | Months to years |
| Consciousness | Impaired | Usually alert | 
| Attention | Impaired | Normal and then impaired | 
| Psychomotor changes | Increased or decreased | Often normal | 
| Hallucinations | Common | Less common (type dependant) |
| Reversibility | Usually reversible | Progressive |

Collateral history may be very useful - if patient has capacity patient needs to consent for the collateral history to be taken.
Assessment of capacity is important 

### Types

- **Hyperactive delirium** - predominantly restless and agitated. Often occurs during night time
- **Hypoactive delirium** - inactive and sleepy. During the day often

## Causes/Factors

**P**ain

**I**nfection - [[Urinary Tract Infection]], [[pneumonia]], [[Cellulitis]], [[Skin Ulcers]]

**N**utrition - B12, folate, glucose, [[Nutritional disorders]]

**C**onstipation - +/- urinary retention, codiene

**H**ydration - intake, diruetics, diarrhoea


**M**edication - prescribed, alcohol and drugs, withdrawal

**E**nvironment/electrolytes

## Symptoms

- **Disturbed Consciousness**: Reduced clarity, orientation, and awareness.
- **Cognitive Dysfunction**: Impaired memory, disorientation, and confusion.
- **Fluctuating Alertness**: Symptoms vary throughout the day.

## Signs

- **Inattention**: Difficulty focusing or sustaining attention.
- **Altered Perception**: Hallucinations or misinterpretation of stimuli.
- **Disorganized Thinking**: Incoherent speech, illogical thoughts.

## Social History

- Who do they live with?
- Alchol, drugs, work
- House - stairs?
- Daily tasks of living - wash, dress
- Shopping?

## Investigations

- **Observations**: full set of obs, ECG, urine dip, glucose
- **Cognitive Assessment**:
	- 4AT - Alertness, Cognition, Attention, Acute changes or fluctuating course
	- MoCA - 


- **Blood Tests**: FBC, U&Es, TFTs, LFTs, HbA1C, Coag screen, Bone profile, Folate & B12, vitamin D
- **Imaging**: CXR for pneumonia, CT head to rule out bleeds, bladder USS 

## Management

- **Address Underlying Cause**: Treat the root medical condition or discontinue offending medications.
- **Environmental Support**: Maintain a quiet, well-lit environment to reduce confusion.
- **Challenging Behaviour**: Frustration is natural if you cannot effectively communicate needs. Medication is an option as a last resort after communication tactics have failed. 
- **Communication**: Always try to *redirect* patients rather than decieve etc. 

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Longer stay in hosptial**: more hosptial aquired complications 
- **Increased Morbidity and Mortality**: Delirium is often a sign of severe illness and have a 2x mortality risk than a normal patient 
- **Risk of Falls and Injuries**: Altered mental status poses safety risks.
- **Potential for Long-Term Cognitive Impairment**: Especially in older adults, delirium can contribute to persistent cognitive decline.
