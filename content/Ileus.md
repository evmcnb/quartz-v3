Affects small bowel where normal peristalsis temporally stops - paralytic  or adynamic ileus

Pseudo-obstruction a functional obstruction of the large bowel. Present with an obstruction but no mechanical cause if found. Less common 

## Causes/Factors

- Injury to the bowel
- Handling of the bowel during surgery
- Inflammation of infection in or nearby the bowel ([[Peritonitis]], [[Appendicitis]], [[pancreatitis]] or [[pneumonia]])
- [[Electrolyte Imbalance]]

Usually occurs after surgery and resolves in a few days with supportive care

## Signs & Symptoms

- Vomiting (particularly **green** **_bilious vomiting_**)
- Abdominal distention 
- Diffuse abdominal pain
- Absolute constipation and lack of flatulence
- Absent bowel sounds (as opposed to the “tinkling” bowel sounds of mechanical obstruction)

## Investigations

- Bloods to look for infection source if cause not known

## Management

The ileus will usually resolve with treatment of the underlying cause. Management involves supportive care.

Supportive care involves:

- **_Nil by mouth_** or limited sips of water
- **_NG tube_** if vomiting
- **_IV fluids_** to prevent dehydration and correct the electrolyte imbalances
- **_Mobilisation_** to helps stimulate peristalsis
- **_Total parenteral nutrition_** (TPN) may be required whilst waiting for the bowel to regain function
