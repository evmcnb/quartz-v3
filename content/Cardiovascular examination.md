#### Palpation

##### Temperature

Place dorsal aspect of your hand onto patients to assess temperature

##### Capillary Refill time

- Apply 5 seconds of pressure onto finger and release
- Should return in <2 seconds
- If >2 seconds suggests poor peripheral perfusion (hypovolaemia, congestive heart failure) and need to assess central cap refill

##### Radial Pulse - Rhythm and Rate

-<span style="color:#ff0000"> Palpate for 30 seconds</span> - 60 if irregular

- Irregular rhythm is most commonly caused by [[Atrial Fibrillation]]

##### Radio-radial Delay

<span style="color:#ff0000">Palpate both radial pulse together</span>. If out of sync +ve test. Causes include:

- <span style="color:#00b0f0"> Subclavian artery stenosis</span> (e.g. compression by a cervical rib)
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Aortic dissection</span>
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Aortic coarctation</span>

##### Collapsing Pulse

A collapsing pulse is a forceful pulse that **rapidly increases** and subsequently **collapses**.
**_Ask patient if in any pain in shoulder as going to have to move it rapidly_**
Causes of a collapsing pulse:

- [[Aortic regurgitation]]
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Thyrotoxicosis</span>
- [[Anaemia]]
- [[Pregnancy]]
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">AV fistula</span>

##### Blood Pressure

**Tell the examiner that you would like to take one**
In a cardiovascular examination OSCE station, you are **unlikely** to have to carry out a thorough blood pressure assessment due to time restraints, however, you should demonstrate that you have an awareness of what this would involve.

## Neck<span style="color:#ff0000"></span>

#### Carotid Pulse

##### Auscultate

Prior to palpating the carotid artery need to rule out the presence of a <span style="color:#ff0000">bruit</span> - which indicates <span style="color:#00b0f0">carotid stenosis</span>

1. Place bell of stethoscope over carotid pulse
2. Ask patient to take a deep breath in and hold
3. Sound of a carotid bruit

   ![[z_attachments/Carotid Bruit Sound.mp3|Carotid Bruit Sound]]

4. The presence of a ‘carotid bruit’ may, in fact, be a **radiating cardiac murmur**

##### Palpate

If no bruits were identified, proceed to **carotid pulse palpation**:
1. Ensure the patient is positioned safely on the bed, as there is a risk of inducing reflex bradycardia when palpating the carotid artery (potentially causing a syncopal episode).
2. Place fingers on carotid
3. Assess the **character** (e.g. slow-rising, thready) and **volume** of the pulse.

#### Jugular Vein

##### Jugular Venous Pressure

Indirect measure of <span style="color:#ff0000">central venous pressure</span> (IJV connects to right atrium without any valves). <span style="color:#00b0f0">Causes include Right</span> [[Heart Failure]], [[Tricuspid regurgitation]]<span style="color:#00b0f0"> and constrictive</span> [[Pericarditis]]

1. Position the patient in a semi-recumbent position (at 45°).
2. Ask the patient to turn their head slightly to the left
3. Inspect for evidence of IJV running between the medial end of the clavicle and the ear lobe, under the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid
4. Measure the JVP by assessing the vertical distance between the **sternal angle** and the **top of the pulsation point of the IJV** (in healthy individuals, this should be **no greater than 3 cm**).

##### Hepatojugular Reflux Test (not Performed in an OSCE)

The hepatojugular reflux test involves the application of pressure to the liver whilst observing for a sustained rise in JVP.

- In healthy individuals, this rise should last **no longer than 1-2 cardiac cycles** (it should then fall).
- If the rise in JVP is **sustained** and **equal to or greater than 4cm** this is deemed a **positive result**.

A **positive hepatojugular reflux result** suggests the **right ventricle is unable to accommodate an increased venous return**, but it is **not diagnostic** of any specific condition. Constrictive [[pericarditis]], right and left ventricular failure and restrictive [[cardiomyopathy]] can cause a positive result

## Chest

#### Inspect

- **Scars suggestive of previous thoracic surgery**
- **Pectus excavatum:** a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest.
- **Pectus carinatum:** protrusion of the sternum and ribs.
- <span style="font-weight:bold; color:#ff0000">Visible pulsations</span>**:** a forceful apex beat may be visible secondary to underlying <span style="color:#00b0f0">ventricular hypertrophy.</span>

### Palpation

##### Apex Beat

- Typically located in <span style="color:#ff0000">5th intercostal space in midclavicular line</span>
- Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to <span style="color:#00b0f0">anything that shifts mediastinum</span>

##### Heaves

A **parasternal heave** is a precordial impulse that can be palpated.

- Place the **heel of your hand** parallel to the **left sternal edge** (fingers vertical) to palpate for heaves.
- If heaves are present you should feel the heel of your hand being **lifted** with each systole.
- Parasternal heaves are typically associated with <span style="color:#00b0f0">left or right ventricular hypertrophy</span>.

##### Thrill

A **thrill** is a **palpable vibration** caused by **turbulent blood flow** through a heart valve (<span style="color:#ff0000">a thrill is a palpable murmur</span>).
You should assess for a thrill across **each of the heart valves** in turn

### Auscultation

1. Palpate the carotid pulse to determine the first heart sound.
2. Auscultate ‘upwards’ through the valve areas using the **diaphragm** of the stethoscope whilst continuing to palpate the carotid pulse:

- **Aortic valve:** 2nd intercostal space at the right sternal edge.
- **Pulmonary valve:** 2nd intercostal space at the left sternal edge.
- **Tricuspid valve:** 4th or 5th intercostal space at the lower left sternal edge.
- **Mitral valve:** 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line.

##### Accentuation Manoeuvres

- **Aortic stenosis** - auscultate the **carotid** **arteries** using the <span style="color:#ff0000">diaphragm</span> of the stethoscope whilst the patient holds their breath to listen for radiation of an **ejection systolic murmur**

  ![[z_attachments/Aortic Stenosis normal speed.mp3|Aortic Stenosis normal speed]]

- **Aortic regurgitation** - sit the patient forwards and auscultate over the **aortic** **area** with the <span style="color:#ff0000">diaphragm</span> of the stethoscope during **expiration** to listen for an **early diastolic murmur**

  ![[z_attachments/Aortic Regurgitation normal speed.mp3|Aortic Regurgitation normal speed]]

- **Mitral regurgitation** - roll the patient onto their **left side** and listen over the mitral area with the <span style="color:#ff0000">diaphragm</span> of the stethoscope **during expiration** for a pansystolic murmur. <span style="color:#ff0000">Continue to auscultate into the axilla to identify radiation of this murmur.</span>

  ![[z_attachments/Mitral Regurgitation normal speed.mp3|Mitral Regurgitation normal speed]]

- **Mitral stenosis** - with the patient **on their left side,** listen over the **mitral area** using the <span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight:bold">bell</span> of the stethoscope **during expiration** for a **mid-diastolic murmur**.

## Final Steps

#### Posterior Chest Wall

- Inspect the posterior chest wall for any deformities or scars

##### Auscultation

Auscultate the lung fields posteriorly:

- <span style="color:#ff0000">Coarse crackles </span>-> [[pulmonary oedema]]
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Absent air entry and stony dullness on percussion</span> -> [[Pleural Effusion]]

##### Sacral Oedema

Inspect and palpate the sacrum for evidence of pitting oedema.

#### Legs

- **Inspect** and **palpate** the patient’s **ankles** for evidence of **pitting pedal oedema** and temperature (associated with right ventricular failure).
- **Inspect** the patient’s **legs** for evidence of **saphenous vein harvesting** (performed as part of a coronary artery bypass graft).

## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.
