Pre-existing conditions and non-obstetric disease cause more maternal deaths in the UK than obstetric complications

Pregnant women should receive the same investigations and treatments as non-pregnant patients with avoidance of harm to the foetus wherever possible

## Radiology

If the uterus is positioned outside the imagining field of view, the radiation dose to the foetus is minimal.
Exposure from the following is well below the threshold of risk to the foetus:

- Plain radiograph: chest, extremities, spine
- CT: head, chest (but consider radiation to maternal breast in pregnancy

Ultrasound and MRI are generally preferred when imaging abdomen

## Drugs

Should always be a balance of risk - drugs different again in lactation
