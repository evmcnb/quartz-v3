Long term inner ear disorder that causes recurrent attacks of vertigo and symptoms of hearing loss and tinnitus.

- It is believed to result from excess fluid accumulation in the labyrinth, leading to increased pressure within the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear.
- Ménière's disease is the term for the idiopathic form of the disorder. If a cause is identified, it is referred to as Ménière's syndrome
