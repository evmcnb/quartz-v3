Carcinoma of the bronchus - second most common cancer in UK, only 5% cured

#### Primary lung tumours 
- 90% are carcinomas
- Non-small cell carcinoma 85%
    - squamous cell carcinoma 20% - presence of keratinization
    - adenocarcinoma 30% - mucin production
    - large cell carcinoma 10%
- Small cell 15% - arise from endocrine cells -> excrete peptides -> paraneoplastic syndromes

Main morphological difference between the two is nuclear characteristics and amount of cytoplasm. Small cell "always" smoking
#### Secondary Lung Tumours
- More common than primary
- Multiple discrete nodules
- Most commonly from breast, GIT, kidney
- Sarcomas
- Melanomas
- Lymphomas


## Causes/Factors

- Smoking (90%)
- asbestos

## Symptoms

- cough
- haemoptysis
- dyspnoea
- chest pain
- weight loss

## Signs

- **[[clubbing]]** of fingers
- anaemia
