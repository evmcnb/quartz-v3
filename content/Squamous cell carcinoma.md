May begin as [[Lumps#Solar (actinic) keratosis|solar (actinic) keratosis]] or be found on the lips of smokers or long standing ulcers (Marjolin's ulcer)

While it tends to grow more quickly than Basal Cell Carcinoma, it is still generally slow-growing and has a low risk of metastasis.

## Causes/Factors

The primary cause of Squamous Cell Carcinoma is prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or tanning beds. Other risk factors include:

- **Fair Skin:** Light-skinned individuals are more susceptible.
- **Chronic Sun Exposure:** Especially without adequate sun protection.
- **Previous Skin Injuries:** Such as burns, scars, or chronic ulcers.
- **Weakened Immune System:** Due to conditions or medications.
- **Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Infection:** In some cases, SCC may be associated with certain strains of HPV. 

## Symptoms

- **Skin Changes:** A persistent, red, scaly patch, a firm, raised nodule, or a wart-like growth.
- **Open Sores:** Sores that don't heal or continuously come back.
- **Bleeding:** Lesions that bleed or ooze.

## Diagnostic Tests

- Referral to a dermatologist for input
- Skin biopsy 

## Management

- Excision
- Radiotherapy for recurrence/affected nodes

## Complications/red Flags

- **Metastasis:** While less common than with melanoma, SCC can metastasize, particularly if left untreated.
- **Local Tissue Damage:** Invasion of surrounding tissues and structures.
- **Recurrence:** SCCs may recur, especially if not completely removed.
