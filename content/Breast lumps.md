Benign breast lumps - see [[Breast carcinoma]] for malignant

## Fibroadenoma

Benign tumours of stromal/epithelial breast duct tissue. Typically small and mobile - sometimes called "breast mouse" as they move around within the breast tissue
- More common in younger women
- Respond to female hormones - therefore regress after menopause
- Painless, smooth, round, well circumscribed, firm, mobile, up to 3 cm diameter

Fibroadenomas are not cancerous and are **not usually associated with an increased risk of  breast cancer**. However complex fibroadenomas and a positive family history of breast cancer may indicate a higher risk.

## Fibrocystic changes 

Generalised lumpiness to the breast - considered a variation of normal and not a disease. Connective tissue, ducts and lobules of the breast respond to the oestrogen and progesterone becoming fibrous and cystic. Fluctuate with the menstrual cycle

Can vary in severity and affect QoL if severe. Management include:
- Exclude cancer
- Wearing a supportive bra
- NSADs
- Avoiding caffeine 
- Hormonal treatments under specialist guidance

## Breast Cysts

Benign individual fluid filled lumps. Most common cause of breast lumps between 30-50 y/o. 

Can be painful and may fluctuate in size over cycle
- Smooth
- Well-circumscribed
- Mobile
- Possibly fluctuant

Require further assessment to exclude cancer with imaging and potentially aspiration or excision

## Fat Necrosis
Lump formed by localised degeneration and scarring of fat tissue, usually triggered by local trauma, radiotherapy or surgery with an inflammation reaction resulting in fibrosis and necrosis. Does not increase the risk of breast cancer. 
- Painless
- Firm
- Irregular
- Fixed in local structures
- May be skin dimpling or nipple inversion

**_Ultrasound_** or **_mammogram_** can show a similar appearance to breast cancer.
Biopsy may be required to confirm diagnosis

Usually managed conservatively; it may resolve spontaneously with time. Surgical excision may be used if required for symptoms.

## Lipoma
Benign fat tissue tumours. Can occur almost anywhere on the body where there is adipose.
- Soft
- Painless
- Mobile
- Do not cause skin changes

They are typically treated conservatively with reassurance. Alternatively, they can be surgically removed.

## Galactocele
Occur in women thatt are lactating often after stopping breastfeeding. Occur when the lactiferous duct is blocked, preventing the gland from draining milk.
- Firm
- Mobile
- Painless lump
- Usually beneath the areola. 
Benign and resolve without treatment. Rarely can become infected and require antibiotics

## Phyllodes tumour

- Rare tumour of connective tissue (stroma)
- Large and fast growing
- Hard to differentiate between this and fibroadenoma
- Benign (~50%), borderline (~25%) or malignant (~25%)
- Malignant tumours can metastasise
- Surgical excision
