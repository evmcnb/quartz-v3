## **Causes/Factors:**

- **Irritants:** Substances that directly damage the skin, such as soaps, detergents, or chemicals.
- **Allergens:** Substances that trigger an allergic reaction, such as certain metals, plants, or cosmetics.

**Clinical Presentation:**

- **Redness:** Erythema at the contact site.
- **Itching:** Pruritus is a common symptom.
- **Swelling and Blisters:** Present in severe cases.

**Diagnostic Tests:**

- **Patch Testing:** Identifying specific allergens causing ACD.
- **Elimination Diet:** In cases of suspected food allergies.

## **Management:**

 1. **Identify and Remove the Trigger:**
	- **Irritant:** Avoid the substance causing irritation.
	- **Allergen:** Identify and eliminate exposure to the allergen.

2. **Topical Treatments:**
	- **Corticosteroid Creams or Ointments:** Reduce inflammation and itching.
	- **Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors:** (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) for certain cases.

 3. **Oral Medications:**
	- **Antihistamines:** Relieve itching and reduce allergic reactions.
	- **Oral Corticosteroids:** In severe cases for a short duration.

4. **Wet Compresses:**
	- Applying cool, wet compresses can soothe the affected area.

 5. **Emollients/Moisturizers:**
	- Use hypoallergenic moisturizers to keep the skin hydrated.

6. **Avoid Scratching:**
	- Scratching can worsen the condition and lead to infection.

7. **Barrier Creams:**
	- In cases of irritant contact dermatitis, use barrier creams to protect the skin.
