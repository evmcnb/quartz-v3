  - Diabetic retinopathy

Most common forms are diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular oedema and cataracts

### Diabetic retinopathy

- Most common diabetes related complication. 
- Metabolic complications cause thickening of basement membrane in small blood vessels in retina and capillary closure. 
- Damage to the wall of small vessels cause microanerysms. 
- Damaged blood vessels leak fluid into the retina. This fluid leaves behind lipids and proteins forming hard exudates
- Micro-infarcts within the retina cause cotton wool spots. 
- These can all be seen on dilated eye exam.

- Fluid from leaking vessels in cleared poorly in the macular area due to anatomical differences. Above a certain point it cannot be cleared **macular oedema** occurs
- This distorts and thickens the macula at the retina.
- Not visible on exam


### Cataracts 

- Develops earlier in people with diabetes tan the general population
- Fluctuations in blood glucose concentration can cause refractive variability as a result of osmotic changes within the lens 
- Resolves with better control

## Causes/Factors

- **[[Diabetes Mellitus]]:** Prolonged elevated blood sugar levels contribute to the development and progression of diabetic eye disease.
- **Duration of Diabetes:** The longer an individual has diabetes, the higher the risk of developing eye complications.
- **Hypertension:** High blood pressure can exacerbate the effects of diabetes on the eyes.

## Symptoms

- **Blurred Vision:** Vision may become blurry, especially in the early stages.
- **Floaters:** Dark spots or floaters may appear in the field of vision.
- **Eye Pain or Pressure:** In advanced stages, individuals may experience pain or pressure in the eyes.

## Signs

- **Retinal Changes:** Fundoscopic examination may reveal abnormalities in the retina, such as microaneurysms or haemorrhages.
- **Macular Oedema:** Swelling of the macula, the central part of the retina, can be a sign of diabetic macular oedema.
- **Cataracts:** Clouding of the eye's lens.
- **Increased Intraocular Pressure:** A risk factor for glaucoma.

## Diagnostic Tests

- **Dilated Eye Exam:** An eye care professional examines the retina and other structures after dilating the pupils.
- **Fluorescein Angiography:** A dye is injected into the bloodstream to highlight blood vessels in the retina.
- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** Imaging technique to assess the thickness of the retina and detect swelling.

## Management

- **Blood Sugar Control:** Tight control of blood glucose levels is crucial to prevent and manage diabetic eye disease.
- **Blood Pressure Management:** Maintaining optimal blood pressure helps protect the eyes.
- **Anti-VEGF Injections:** Injections may be used to treat diabetic macular edema.
- **Surgery:** Advanced cases may require surgery, such as vitrectomy for retinal issues.

## Complications/Red Flags

- **Vision Loss:** Progressive vision loss can occur if diabetic eye disease is not adequately managed.
- **Retinal Detachment:** In severe cases, the retina may detach.
- **Glaucoma:** Increased risk of developing glaucoma, leading to optic nerve damage.
