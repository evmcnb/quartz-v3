- Abnormalities of kidney function or structure present on at least 2 occasions >3 months apart.
- Unlikely to be reversible
- CKD replaces the term chronic renal failure.

5 Stages dependent upon eGFR and albumin/creatine ratio (ACR)

## Causes/Factors

- [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- [[Essential hypertension|Hypertension]]
- Age 75+
- [[Glomerulonephritis]]
- Obstruction of kidney (without acute effect)
- [[Polycystic Kidney Disease]]
- [[Alport Syndrome]]
- APOL 1 Gene
- [[Acute Kidney Injury]]
- [[Reflux Nephropathy]]
- Chronic nephrotoxin use

## Symptoms

- Silent disease
- May not manifest until significant decrease in kidney function

- Reduced urine output
- Aches and pains
- Salt and water retention
- Loss of lean body mass-muscle weakness
- Vomiting etc

## Diagnostic Tests

- Bloods - eGFR
- Urinalysis - blood/protein uACR annually
- BP

Distinguish between AKI and CKD: baseline creatinine value. Favouring CKD:

- anaemia
- low calcium
- high phosphate
- elevated parathroid hormone
- Ultrasound appearances

## Management

- Change life style to reduce risk
- Tolvaptan (for [[Polycystic Kidney Disease]])

Kidney Replacement Therapy

- Haemodialysis
- Peritoneal Dialysis
- Transplantation

Palliative Care sometimes as its a lot of effort to continue with dialysis

- SGLT 2 Inhibitors
  - reduces declining kidney function
  - reduces risk of end stage kidney disease
  - Or dying from causes related to the kidneys or cardiovascular system
  - Ongoing studies to evaluate in patients with CKD without diabetes

## Complications/red Flags

- Increased risk of other outcomes
  - [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
  - [[Acute Kidney Injury]]
  - Hyperparathyroidism (low Ca, low activated vit D, high phosphate causes increased PTH )
  - Anaemia
  - Hypertension
