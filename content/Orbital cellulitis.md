Infection that involves the muscle and fat within the orbit - posterior to the orbital septum

More common in children than adults - 16x more

Differentiation between [[Periorbital cellulitis]] and orbital cellulitis can be difficult in the initial stages of infection

> [!danger] Sight threatening condition
> 
> Approximately 11% of patients will have vision loss following orbital cellulitis 


## Causes/Factors

- Local spreading infection of an acute bacterial sinusitis - typically from the paranasal sinuses
- Less common causes include the extension of [[Periorbital cellulitis]], haematogenous spread, orbit trauma or contiguous spread from face or teeth from recent surgery or dental infection

## Clinical Features

- Erythema and swelling around the eye
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Painful eye movements</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Change in colour vision</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Change in visual acuity/fields</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Proptosis</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Chemosis (swelling on conjunctiva)</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Relevant afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) - Marcus-Gunn pupil</mark>
- Fever

In the history must ask about: 
- PMH - previous episodes of eye disease
- Cause - any precipitating cause
- Duration of symptoms
- Laterality (uni or bi)
- Severity of symptoms - worsening or improving

Exam look for:
- Nasal exam - ipsilateral nasal discharge
- Oral cavity exam - assess oral hygiene, any evidence of dental disease
- **Examination of eyes and vision** - visual fields, visual acuity, colour vision, pupil response, proptosis, slit lamp exam
- **Neurological examination** - cranial nerve exam including assessment for meningism 

## Investigations

- FBC - may show elevated WBC - particularly neutrophilia
- CRP
- Lactate if patient is septic
- Blood cultures - *Staph spp. Streptomyces spps. Haemophilus spps.*
- MC&S
- Contrast enhanced CT head including orbit and sinuses 

## Management

- IV antibiotics 7-10 days - choice depends on local guidelines
- Surgical drainage of pus if abscess seen on imaging 

## Complications/red Flags

- Cavernous sinus thrombosis
- Loss of vision
- Intracerebral abscess
- Meningitis 
- Death (rarely)
