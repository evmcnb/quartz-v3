Two types - ischemia or haemorrhagic

**Ischemic** - clot blocks supply to distal parts of brain to where that clot got lodged

**Haemorrhagic** - bleeding in the brain causing lack of perfusion (plus irritation to that part of brain)

Ischemia can lead to haemorrhagic (haemorrhagic transformation of ischemic stroke )

## Causes/Factors

^095aff

Small vessel occlusion/cerebral microangiopathy or thrombosis 
- Cardiac emboli ([[Atrial Fibrillation]])
- Atherothromboembolism (from carotids)
- Aneurism
- CNS bleeds

### DDX

- Head injury
- Hypo/hyperglycaemia
- Tumour
- **Migraine**

## Modifiable risk factors
- [[Essential hypertension|Hypertension]]
- Smoking
- [[Diabetes Mellitus]]
- [[Atrial Fibrillation]]
- $\uparrow$ PCV (packed cell volume)
- Carotid bruit
- Other substances that affect clotting

## Signs

- Sudden onset
- Worst at onset
- Severe headache
- Maybe contralateral or hemiplegia
  - face - weakening/drooping
  - arms - weakness
- Slurred speech
- 5 syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure motor, pure sensory, sensorimotor and dysarthria/clumsy head

##### ROSIER - recognition of stroke in the emergencey room

| Symptom | Score |
| ---- | ---- |
| LOC/syncope | -1 |
| Seizure activity | -1 |
| Asymmetrical facial weakness | +1 |
| Asymmetrical leg weakness | +1 |
| Speech Disturbance | +1 |
| Visual field defect | +1 |
\>1 stroke possible 
## Diagnostic Tests

- CT/MRI rapidly to differentiate between ischemic or haemorrhagic
  Looking for source of clot
  - Full neuro exam
- ECG to look for AF
- BP for hypertension
- Echo for atherothromboembolism in carotid and AF
- Glucose to rule out hypo/hyperglycaemia
- Any blood issues that cause $\uparrow$ coagulability, lipid profile, HbA1c, LFT, U&E, CRP, FBC


## Management

For haemorrhagic confirmed :
- Reverse anticoagulants if possible (vitamin K for warfarin, idarucizumab for dabigatran)
- Neurosurgical discussion -  coiling (endovascular embolization) can be used to stop further bleeding. Surgery can also be done to remove excess blood and reduce intracranial pressure


Once haemorrhagic excluded:

- Aspirin 300mg Stat NG/PO/PR and also PO for 2 weeks then switch to long term antithrombic treatment (e.g. clopidogrel)
- Thrombolysis considered if <4.5h since symptom onset - best results within 90mins
- <6h since symptom onsnet and PAC occulsion - thrombectomy (cerebral angioplasty)

**Screen swallow** - nil by mouth until this is done (keep hydrated)

## Rehabilitation 

- Swallow test - check for signs of aspiration or voice change
- Falls risk assessment
- Bladder and bowel care
- **Physiotherapy** - monitor progress 
- Monitor mood
- Drugs - High dose statins: 80mg atorvastatin, anticoagulation in AF: DOAC, anti-platelets, anti-diabetics
