Folliculitis is a common skin condition that causes red bumps or pustules around hair follicles. Infections (bacterial, fungal, or viral) and factors like friction, shaving, or a weakened immune system contribute to its development.

## Causes/Factors

- **Infections:** Bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), Fungi (Malassezia), Virus (Herpes Simplex)
- **Irritation or Trauma:** Friction, shaving, tight clothing.
- **Compromised Immune System:** HIV/AIDS, diabetes.
- **Waterborne Bacteria:** Pseudomonas aeruginosa in hot tubs or pools.
- **Topical Steroid Use:** Prolonged use leading to steroid folliculitis.

## Clinical Presentation 

Folliculitis appears as small red bumps, itching, clusters, or ulcers in severe cases.

## Diagnostic Tests 

Clinical examination and lesion culture help identify the infectious agent.

## Management

- **Topical Medications:** Antibiotics or antifungals for bacterial or fungal folliculitis.
- **Oral Medications:** Antibiotics or antifungals for severe cases.
- **Warm Compresses:** Relieve discomfort and promote drainage.
- **Avoiding Irritants:** Preventive measures to reduce friction and trauma.

**Complications/Red Flags** -  boils, cellulitis, and scarring, especially with chronic cases.
