## Introduction

- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)
- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves
- Gain consent to continue
- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing

## Olfactory Nerve (1) and Glossopharyngeal (9)

##### Have You Noticed Any Change in Smell or Taste?

## Optic Nerve (2)

##### Snellen Test

- Ensure that the patient is wearing glasses if normally does so
- Ask patient to **cover one eye**
- Ensure patient is correct distance (6m effective) away
- Move closer (3m) if unable to read at 6m

##### Visual Fields

- Ask patient to **cover one eye**
- Ask patient to let you know when they can see the finger
- Ensure the finger is in the mid line
- Check each corner of field and repeat on other eye

##### Fundoscopy
- Make sure your left eye is looking into their left eye to avoid complete face to face positioning!
- Follow arteries towards the optic disc - they usually branch in a way to form arrow shapes that point towards the optic disc

##### Check Pupil Size and Alignment

##### Check Pupillary Reflexes

- Direct and consensual


#### Vagus (10) and Hypoglossal (12)

While you have the light in your hand might as well assess other things that require it

- Ask patient to open their mouth and say ahh
- Ask patient to stick out their tongue
- Check for any deviation

##### Say You Would Assess Colour Using Ishihara Chart

## Oculomotor (3), Trochlear (4) and Abducens (6)

##### H Finger Follow Test

- Ask patient to follow finger for eyes
- On lateral movement go a bit further than what the patient can do and watch for nystagmus

##### Accommodation

- Move finger towards nose of patient and watch for eyes

## Trigeminal (5)

##### Fine touch Sensation

- Get some cotton wool
- Give patient reference of what it will feel like somewhere other than their face
- Tell them to say when they can feel it
- Test all divisions of trigeminal on both sides

##### Course touch

- Repeat with a neurotip instead of cotton wool

##### Assess Muscles of Mastication

- Feel for temporalis & masseter muscles for atrophy
- Ask for jaw to be open and for it to resist closing it

##### ? Jaw Jerk

- Ask patient to relax jaw
- Place finger on mentalis muscle and hit with tendon hammer

## Facial Nerve (7)

##### Facial Expression Assessment

Check for symmetry each time

- Ask patient to raise eyebrows
- Scrunch up eyes and don't let me open them
- Puff out cheek and don't let me get any air out
- Purse lips
- Bare teeth

## Vestibulocochlear (8)

##### Have You Been Hearing Sounds Louder than Usual?

##### Whispering Hearing Test

Explain to patient that you are going to go behind them and whisper a number and you want them to repeat what they heard

- Assess at 15cm and 60cm
- Test **one ear at a time**
- Whisper a number and check patient response is the same

##### Rinne's Test
To test whether bone conduction is louder than air conduction. Conduct test on both ears

- Ask patient if they can hear the vibrating tuning fork help at the entrance to the ear canal.
- Then place the vibrating fork on the mastoid process
- Then ask which is loudest

In normal hearing the test is positive - and air conduction is louder than bone conduction

##### Weber's Test
Used in conjunction with Rinne's test to rule out unilateral deafness

- Place tuning fork in the centre of the patient's forehead and ask whether they can hear this equally on both sides or more on one side.
- If its louder in one ear it could mean either an ipsilateral conductive hearing loss or contralateral sensorineural hearing loss

## Accessory Nerve (11)

##### Test Power of Shoulder Shrug and Neck Turning
Accessory supplies trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles

## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.
