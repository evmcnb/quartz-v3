## Introduction

- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)
- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves
- Gain consent to continue
- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing

## General Observation

- Conscious level
- Speech slurring
- Facial asymmetry
- Problem with eyelids
- Obvious limb weakness

- Walking aids
- Hearing aids
- Visual aids

## Olfactory Nerve (1)

- <span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight:bold">Have You Noticed Any Change in Smell?</span>

## Optic Nerve (2)

<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight:bold">Have you ever had any problems with your vision or noticed any changes?</span>

<span style="color:#ff0000; font-weight:bold"> Do you wear glasses? </span>

##### Snellen Test

- Ensure that the patient is wearing glasses if normally does so
- Ask patient to **cover one eye**
- Ensure patient is correct distance (6m effective) away
- Move closer (3m) if unable to read at 6m

##### Visual Fields

- Ask patient to **cover one eye**
- Ask patient to let you know when they can see the finger
- Ensure the finger is in the mid line
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Test 4 quadrants of field</span> and repeat on other eye
  Could also perform visual inattention and blind spot test

##### Fundoscopy

- Offer to do
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Red reflex</span> - absent may indicate <span style="color:#00b0f0">cataract</span>
- Make sure your left eye is looking into their left eye to avoid complete face to face positioning!
- Follow arteries towards the optic disc - they usually branch in a way to form arrow shapes that point towards the optic disc
- Find 4 vessels and look in each quadrant

##### Check Pupil Size and Alignment

##### Check Pupillary Reflexes

- Direct and consensual
- Issues with <span style="color:#ff0000">direct reflex</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN2 lesion</span>
- Issues with <span style="color:#ff0000">consensual reflex</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN3 lesion</span>

##### Accommodation

- Move finger towards nose of patient and watch for eyes - both pupils should constrict as the eyes converge

##### Say You Would Assess Colour Using Ishihara Chart

## Oculomotor (3), Trochlear (4) and Abducens (6)

##### H Finger Follow Test

- Ask patient to follow finger for eyes
- On lateral movement go a bit further than what the patient can do and watch for nystagmus
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Eye cannot move in and down </span>- <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN4 lesion (superior oblique)</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Eye cannot move laterally</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN6 lesion (lateral rectus)</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Eye cannot move in other directions</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN3 lesions (other intraocular muscles)</span>

## Trigeminal (5)

##### Fine touch Sensation

- Get some cotton wool
- Give patient reference of what it will feel like somewhere other than their face
- Tell them to say when they can feel it
- Test all divisions of trigeminal on both sides

##### Course touch

- Repeat with a neurotip instead of cotton wool

##### Assess Muscles of Mastication

- Feel for temporalis & masseter muscles for atrophy
- Ask for jaw to be open and for it to resist closing it

##### ? Corneal reflex

- <span style="color:#ff0000">Small touch on corneal with cotton to elicit blink</span>
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN 5 afferent CN 7 efferent</span>

##### ? Jaw Jerk

- Ask patient to relax jaw
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Place finger on mentalis</span> muscle and hit with tendon hammer
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">Exaggerated jerk is bad usually to side of lesion </span>

## Facial Nerve (7)

##### Facial Expression Assessment

Check for symmetry each time

- <span style="color:#ff0000">Ask patient to raise eyebrows and don't let me push them down</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">frontalis</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Scrunch up eyes and don't let me open them</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">orbicularis oculi</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Smile and show teeth and then purse lips</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">orbicularis oris</span>
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Puff out cheek and don't let me get any air out</span> - <span style="color:#00b0f0">buccinators</span>

## Vestibulocochlear (8)

##### Have You Been Hearing Sounds Louder than Usual?

##### Whispering Hearing Test

Explain to patient that you are going to go behind them and <span style="color:#ff0000">whisper a number and you want them to repeat what they heard</span>

- Assess at 15cm and 60cm
- Test **one ear at a time**
- Whisper a number and <span style="color:#ff0000">check patient response is the same</span>

##### Rinne's Test

<span style="color:#ff0000">To test whether bone conduction is louder than air conduction</span>. Conduct test on both ears

- Ask patient if they can hear the vibrating tuning fork help at the entrance to the ear canal.
- Then place the vibrating fork on the mastoid process
- Then ask which is loudest

In normal hearing the test is positive - and <span style="color:#ff0000">air conduction is louder than bone conduction</span>

##### Weber's Test

Used in conjunction with Rinne's test to <span style="color:#ff0000">rule out unilateral deafness</span>

- Place tuning fork in the centre of the patient's forehead and ask whether they can hear this equally on both sides or more on one side.
- <span style="color:#00b0f0"> If its louder in one ear it could mean either an ipsilateral conductive hearing loss or contralateral sensorineural hearing loss
  </span>

## Glossopharyngeal (9)

- **Have you experienced any changes in taste?**

##### ? Gag reflex

- Offer to do
- <span style="color:#ff0000">Touch posterior pharynx on either side</span>
- <span style="color:#00b0f0">CN 9 is afferent CN 10 is efferent</span>

#### Vagus (10) and Hypoglossal (12)

While you have the light in your hand might as well assess other things that require it

- Ask patient to open their mouth and say ahh - <span style="color:#ff0000">palate should rise equally</span> (vagus) - <span style="color:#00b0f0">uvula deviates away from lesions </span>
- Ask patient to stick out their tongue and <span style="color:#ff0000">move side to side</span> (hypoglossal) - <span style="color:#00b0f0">deviation towards lesion</span>

## Accessory Nerve (11)

##### Test Power of Shoulder Shrug and Neck Turning

<span style="color:#00b0f0">Accessory supplies trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles</span>

## End Pieces

- Peripheral nerve exam
- MRI/CT head
- LP

## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.
