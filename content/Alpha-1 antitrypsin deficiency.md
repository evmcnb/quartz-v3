An inherited disorder affecting lung ([[emphysema]]) and liver ([[Liver Cirrhosis]]). A1AT is a glycoprotein and a serine protease inhibitor made in the liver which controls inflammatory cascades. In children more likely to cause liver symptoms, in adults more lung.

## Symptoms

Symptomatic patients usually have the PiZZ genotype (homozygous for condition)

- dyspnoea from emphysema
- [[Liver Cirrhosis]]
- cholestatic [[Jaundice]]

Cholestasis often remits in adolescence

## Diagnostic Tests

- Serum A1AT level usually $\downarrow$ or lower limit of normal. Inflammation may hide a lower level
- Lung function test $FEV_1$ reductions
- Liver biopsy
- Phenotyping
- Prenatal diagnosis

## Management

- Smoking cessation
- Vaccination to protect against lung infections
- Liver transplant if liver failed
- Lung transplant
