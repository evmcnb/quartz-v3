## Introduction

- **Wash hands** (and don PPE if needed)
- **Introduce yourself** (name and role)
- Confirm patient's **name** and **DOB**
- Explain what the examination involves
- Gain consent to continue
- Ask if patient in any **pain** before continuing

#### Gather equipment

## General Inspection

#### Clinical Signs

- General appearance and alertness
- Obvious limb amputation

#### Objects and Equipment

- Medical equipment - oxygen, ECG, medications, catheters (note volume and colour), IV access
- Mobility aids
- Prosthetic limbs
- Vital sign charts
- Fluid balance charts
- Prescription


## Inspection of legs, foot and toes

- Colour
- Oedema
- Ulceration, trauma, which the patient might not be complaining about due to [[Diabetes Mellitus]] neuropathy
- Varicose veins
- Missing digits
- Check in-between toes and back of legs for fungal infections/ulcers
- trophic skins changes: hair loss, discoloured skin, dry skin, thickened nails

#### 6 Ps of acute limb ischaemia  
- Pale
- Pulseless
- Painful
- Paralysed
- Paraesthetic
- Perishingly cold

## Palpation & Auscultation 

##### Capillary Refill time
- Apply 5 seconds of pressure onto finger and release
- Should return in <2 seconds
- If >2 seconds suggests poor peripheral perfusion (hypovolaemia, congestive heart failure) and need to assess central cap refill

##### Gross motor
- Ask the patient to wiggle their toes

##### Assess temperature and sensation
- Using back of hand, start at toes and compare each side
- Ask the patient to close their eyes and use light touch to assess for any sensory deficit

##### Check oedema 
- Is it pitting or firm

##### Palpate arteries
Compare side to side
- Dorsalis pedis
- Posterior tibial 
- Popliteal 

##### Say you will palpate femoral pulses but usually not performed in OSCE
- Say you will check for volume, bruits, and radio-femoral delay

##### Palpate and auscultate the aorta 
- Check for deviations, aneurysms, bruits, volume 


## To Complete the Exam

- **Explain** to the patient that the examination is now **finished**.
- **Thank the patient** for their time.
- **Dispose of PPE** appropriately and **wash your hands**.
- **Summarise** your findings.
