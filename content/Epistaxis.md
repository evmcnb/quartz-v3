- Tumours ([[Squamous cell carcinoma]])

General

## Signs

## Investigations

- FBC - if bleeding heavy or recurrent or anaemia is supsected
- Coag - if clotting disorder is suspected


## Management

ABCDE if haemodynamically unstable
- Person should sit with their upper body tilted forward and their mouth open - soft part of the nose should be pinched firmly for 10-15 mins

Acute epistaxis
- If the person is haemodynamically stable, epistaxis can usually be managed with first-aid measures. 
- If a posterior bleed is suspected (bleeding is profuse, from both nostrils, and the bleeding site cannot be identified on examination), admission to hospital is recommended.
- If bleeding doesn't stop after 10-15 minutes of pressure nasal packing may be used if available in primary care otherwise transfer to A&E 

Recurrent epistaxis:
- Topical antiseptic treatment such as Naseptin® (chlorhexidine and neomycin) cream to reduce crusting and vestibulitis, or
- Nasal cautery (if the expertise and facilities are available in primary care), or
- Referral to an ear, nose, and throat specialist if epistaxis is recurrent despite treatment, or there is a high risk of a serious underlying cause.

## Complications/red Flags
- Hypovolaemia 
- Anaemia
