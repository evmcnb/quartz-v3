Thrombosis of the cerebral sinuses or veins causes cerebral infarction but much rarer than arterial disease.

Seizures common and often focal.

Most commonly sagittal sinus thrombosis (47%) or transverse sinus thrombosis (35%)
## Causes/Factors

- Anything that promotes a hypercoagulable state
- [[Pregnancy]]
- Combined oral contraceptive pill
- Head injury
- Dehydration
- Tumours

## Symptoms

Symptom onset is gradual - days to weeks. Features are dependant on what sinus is affected

- **Sagittal sinus** - headache, vomiting, seizures, $\downarrow$ vision, papilloedema 
- **Transverse sinus** - headache $\pm$ mastoid pain, focal CNS signs, seizures, papilloedemaa
- **Sigmoid sinus** - cerebellar signs, lower cranial nerve palsies
- **Inferior petrosal sinus** - _V_ th and _VI_ th cranial nerve palsies with temporal and retro-orbital pain
- **Cavernous sinus** - often due to spread from facial pustules or folliculitis causing headache, chemosis (swelling of eye surface membrane), odematous eyelids, proptosis, painful ophthalmoplegia, fever

## Cortical vein thrombosis

Usually occurs with a sinus thrombosis as it extends into the cortical veins causing infarction into venous territories. These cause **slow** onset, stroke-like symptoms. 

There are often an associated seizures and a "Thunderclap" headache which may come on suddenly

## Diagnostic Tests

Exclude [[Subarachnoid haemorrhage]] if there is a thunderclap headache

- Thrombophilla blood screen
- CT/MRI venography 
- LP if no increase in pressure 

## Management

Seek expert help 
- Anticoagulation with heparin or LWMH
- Monitor carefully for signs of deterioration

## Complications/red Flags

- Deterioration despite anticoagulation
- $\uparrow$ ICP 
- Secondary cerebral haemorrhage
