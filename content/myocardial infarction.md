Belongs to a group of [[Acute Coronary Syndrome|acute coronary syndromes]] along with unstable [[Angina]]. These share a common pathology atherosclerotic plaque rupture, thrombosis and inflammation. However may also be rarely due to emboli, coronary spasm or vasculitis

Myocardial infarction - there is myocardial cell death -> release of troponin
Ischaemia - lack of blood supply (possible not cell death - no troponin in unstable angina)

Subendocardial myocardium is relatively poorly perfused under normal conditions. Given:

- stable atheromatous occlusion of the coronary circulation
- an acute hypotensive episode
  The subendocardial myocardium can infarct without any acute coronary occlusion (NSTEMI)

## Causes/Factors

- Age
- Family history of [[Coronary Artery Disease]]
- Smoking
- [[Essential hypertension|Hypertension]]
- [[Familial hypercholesterolaemia]]
- Hyperlipidaemia
- Obesity
- Sedentary lifestyle
- Cocaine use

## Symptoms

- Severe crushing central/generalised pain - sudden onset
- Often pain radiates out to left arm/neck
- Nausea
- Dyspnoea
- Palpitations
- Syncope
- Pulmonary oedema

## Signs

- Distress
- Anxiety
- Vomiting
- Sweatiness
- Possible $\uparrow HR, \downarrow BP$

## Diagnostic Tests

- ECG - ST elevation (STEMI)
- Bloods - raised troponin, cardiac enzymes, creatine kinase
- Echo to see area of reduced contraction
- Coronary angio to show which artery is blocked

## Management

Acute:

- pain management (morphine)
- antiemetic
- anticoagulant?
- oral aspirin
- Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (aka primary or PCI)

Post MI:

- $\beta$ blocker
- ACEi
- High dose statin

## Complications/red Flags

- Arrhythmias
- [[Pericarditis]]
- [[Cardiac Tamponade]]
- LV/RV failure
