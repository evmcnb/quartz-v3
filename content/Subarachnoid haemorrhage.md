Bleeding into the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater - **subarachnoid**
## Causes/Factors

- **Aneurysms:** Berry aneurysm rupture (80%) - common locations: junctions of posterior communicating with the internal carotid artery or anterior communicating with anterior cerebral artery
- **Trauma:** Head injury or trauma can lead to bleeding.
- **Arteriovenous Malformations (AVMs):** Abnormal connections between arteries and veins in the brain.
- **Blood-Thinning Medications:** Medications like anticoagulants can increase the risk of bleeding.
- **Family History:** A family history of aneurysms or SAH 3-5x risk
- **Other conditions:** That increase risk of aneurysms eg [[Ehlers-Danlos syndrome]], [[Polycystic Kidney Disease]] 

## Symptoms

- **Severe Headache:** "Thunderclap" headache
- **Neck Pain and Stiffness:** Due to irritation of the meninges
- **Nausea and Vomiting:** Often accompanied by the headache.
- **Altered Consciousness:** Confusion, loss of consciousness, or coma.
- **Seizures:** In some cases.
- **Sensitivity to Light (Photophobia) and Sound (Phonophobia):** Due to increased intracranial pressure.

## Signs

- **Positive Kernig's and Brudzinski's Signs:** Takes 6h to develop - Pain on passive extension on knee and passive flexion of neck

## Diagnostic Tests

- Urgent CT - detects over 95% of SAH within 24h
- LP if CT is -ve and history is very suggestive. Must be done 12+ hours after headache onset to allow for breakdown of RBCs

## Management

Refer all confirmed SAH to neurosurgery
- Re-examine to determine if condition worsening - possible repeat CT
- Blood pressure control - <160mmHg
- Nimodipine 60mg/4h for 3wks (Ca$^{2+}$ antagonist to prevent vasospasm)

Surgery: endovascular coiling vs surgical clipping depends on location of aneurysm, but coiling is preferred

## Complications/red Flags

- Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death and occurs in 20% 
- Vasospasm leading to cerebral ischaemia may cause permanent CNS deficit and commonest cause of morbidity
- Hydrocephalus due to blockage of arachnoid granulations requires a shunt or drain
