Acute bacterial infection of the biliary tree and one of the **most severe complication of gallstones**

Obstruction of the biliary tree leads to bile stasis and bacterial (usually gram-negative anaerobes) infection. 

As time progresses this infection ascends towards the liver


## Causes/Factors

- Choledocholithiasis (gallstones)
- Biliary strictures

## Symptoms

- Fever
- RUQ pain
- Jaundice
- N&V

## Signs

> [!abstract] Charcot's triad
>- Fever 
>- RUQ pain
>- Jaundice

**Reynold's pentad** - Charcot's triad + altered mental status + hypotension

## Investigations

- FBC, CRP - elevated WCC and CRP
- Sepsis screen - **thrombocytopenia**, **coagulopathies** and a **raised lactate**.
- LFTs - obstructive jaundice (raised ALP and bilirubin)
- USS to looked for a dilated bile duct - if -ve CTA contrast should be requested

## Management

[[Sepsis]] pathway if septic - broad-spec IV antibiotics and IV fluids

ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) - diagnostic and used to decompress the biliary tree urgently 

Surgery may be necessary for patients with severe or complicated acute cholangitis, such as those with perforation, gangrenous cholecystitis, or biliary sepsis.

Analgesia

Lifestyle advice to reduce gallstone recurrence 

## Complications/red Flags

- **[[pancreatitis]]**: Concomitant inflammation of the pancreas due to biliary obstruction or pancreatic duct involvement.
- **Biliary Perforation**: Rupture of the bile ducts leading to bile peritonitis, abscess formation, or intra-abdominal sepsis.
- **Hepatic Abscess**: Secondary infection and abscess formation within the liver parenchyma due to bacterial seeding from the biliary system.
