To make edits, you can open any of the files and make changes directly and save it. You can organize content into any subfolder you\u0026rsquo;d like.\nTo edit the main home page, open /content/_index.md.\nTo create a link between notes in your garden, just create a normal link using Markdown pointing to the document in question. Please note that all links should be relative to the root /content path.\n1 2  For example, I want to link this current document to `setup/config.md`. [A link to the config page](setup/config.md)   Similarly, you can put local images anywhere in the /content folder.\n1 2  Example image (source is in content/setup/images/example.png) ![Example Image](/content/setup/images/example.png)   You can also use wikilinks if that is what you are more comfortable with!\nFront Matter #  Hugo is picky when it comes to metadata for files.

Excoriations:¬†scratch marks that may be caused by the patient trying to relieve pruritis. In the context of an abdominal examination, this may suggest underlying cholestasis. Needle track marks:¬†important to note as intravenous drug use can be associated with an increased risk of viral hepatitis.  Axillae #  Whilst supporting the patient‚Äôs arm,¬†inspect¬†each¬†axilla¬†for the following:\n Acanthosis nigricans:¬†darkening (hyperpigmentation) and thickening (hyperkeratosis) of the axillary skin which can be benign (most commonly in dark-skinned individuals) or associated with insulin resistance (e.g. type 2 diabetes mellitus) or gastrointestinal malignancy (most commonly stomach cancer). Hair loss:¬†loss of axillary hair associated with iron-deficiency anaemia and malnutrition.  Face #  Eyes #   Conjunctival pallor:¬†underlying anaemia Jaundice:¬†most evident in the superior portion of the sclera (ask the patient to look downwards as you lift their upper eyelid). Corneal arcus:¬†a hazy white, grey or blue opaque ring located in the peripheral cornea. In older patients, the condition is considered benign, however, if patient \u0026lt;50 - underlying hypercholesterolaemia. Xanthelasma:¬†yellow, raised cholesterol-rich deposits around the eyes associated with hypercholesterolaemia. Kayser-Fleischer rings:¬†dark rings that encircle the iris associated with [[Wilson‚Äôs disease]]. The disease involves abnormal copper processing by the liver, resulting in accumulation and deposition in various tissues (causing [[Liver Cirrhosis]]).  Lymph Nodes #  The left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow\u0026rsquo;s node) receives lymphatic drainage from the abdominal cavity so can be one of the first signs of intraabdominal malignancy\n Palpate lymph nodes   Chest #  Inspect #   Spider naevi:¬†skin lesions caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen. Can be a normal finding in pregnancy or in women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill. If more than 5 are present it is more likely to be associated with pathology such as [[liver cirrhosis]]. Gynaecomastia:¬†enlargement of male breast tissue caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen (e.g. liver cirrhosis). Other causes include medications such as digoxin and spironolactone. Hair loss:¬†also caused by increased levels of circulating oestrogen. General malnourishment can also result in hair loss.  Abdomen #  Position the patient lying flat on the bed.\nInspect #   Scars - past surgery Abdominal distension - six f\u0026rsquo;s: fat, fluid, flatus, faeces, foetus or fucking large tumour Caput medusae - engorged paraumbilical veins associated with portal hypertension Striae -stretch marks - [[Liver Cirrhosis|ascites]], intrabdominal malignancy, [[Cushing\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome]], obesity [[Pregnancy]] Hernias - ask patient to cough  Abdominal Palpation #  Ask the patient if they are aware of any areas of abdominal pain (if present examine last). Keep good eye contact to look for discomfort\nLight Palpation of the Abdomen #   Tenderness:¬†note the abdominal region(s) involved and the severity of the pain. Rebound tenderness:¬†said to be present when the abdominal wall, having been compressed slowly, is released rapidly and results in sudden sharp abdominal pain. Weakly associated with peritonitis Voluntary guarding:¬†contraction of the abdominal muscles in response to pain Involuntary guarding/rigidity:¬†involuntary tension in the abdominal muscles that occurs on palpation associated with peritonitis (e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis). Masses:¬†large or superficial masses (e.g. hernias) may be noted on light palpation.  Deep Palpation #  Warn the patient this may feel uncomfortable - carefully monitor face If any¬†masses¬†are identified during deep palpation, assess the following characteristics:\n Location:¬†note which of the nine abdominal regions the mass located within. Size and shape:¬†assess the approximate size and shape of the mass. Consistency:¬†assess the consistency of the mass (e.g. smooth, soft, hard, irregular). Mobility:¬†assess if the mass appears to be attached to superficial or underlying structures. Pulsatility:¬†note if the mass feels pulsatile, suggestive of vascular aetiology (e.g. abdominal aortic aneurysm).  Palpate Liver #   Begin in right iliac fossa starting using flat edge of right hand Ask patient to take deep breath and begin to palpate and see if can feel edge of liver Repeat process moving 1-2cm superiorly each time If you are able to identify the¬†liver edge, assess the following characteristics:  Degree of extension below the costal margin:¬†if greater than 2 cm this suggests hepatomegaly. Consistency of the liver edge:¬†a nodular consistency is suggestive of cirrhosis. Tenderness: hepatic tenderness may suggest hepatitis or cholecystitis (as you may be palpating the gallbladder) Pulsatility:¬†pulsatile hepatomegaly is associated with tricuspid regurgitation.    Palpate Gallbladder #  In healthy individuals the gallbladder isn\u0026rsquo;t usually palpable. If palpable suggests enlargement secondary to biliary flow obstruction and/or infection ([[Cholecystitis]]) Murphy\u0026rsquo;s sign\n Position fingers at the right costal margin in mid-clavicular line Ask patient to take a deep breath If patient suddenly stops mid-breath due to pain, suggests [[Cholecystitis]] - Murphy\u0026rsquo;s sign positive  Palpate the Spleen #   Same process and beginning as liver but move towards left costal margin instead of right In healthy individuals you should not be able to palpate the spleen.  Ballot the Kidneys #   Place hands in this position and push fingers together  Ask patient to take a deep breath and feel for kidney moving down If kidney ballotable describe size and consistency Repeat on other side In healthy individuals the kidneys are not usually ballotable but in low BMI patients might be possible   Bilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidneys can occur in [[polycystic kidney disease]] or [[amyloidosis]]. A unilaterally enlarged, ballotable kidney can be caused by a renal tumour.  Palpate the Aorta #  1.¬†Using both hands perform deep palpation just superior to the umbilicus in the midline. 2.¬†Note the movement of your fingers should be superiorly not laterally which might suggest an expansile mass (AAA)\nPalpate the Bladder #  Warm might be uncomfortable and made cause the urge to go to the toilet. A distended bladder can be palpated in the¬†suprapubic area¬†arising from behind the¬†pubic symphysis¬†(e.g. urinary obstruction/retention). In most healthy patients who are passing urine regularly, the bladder will¬†not¬†be palpable.\n Use side of left hand to palpate from umbilical region downwards  Abdominal Percussion #  Percuss the Liver #   Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards right costal margin until the percussion note changes to dull Continue to percuss upward until the note changes back to resonant indicating the upper border Determine approximate size of liver  Percuss the Spleen #   Start at right iliac fossa and percuss towards left costal margin The spleen should not be identifiable using percussion in healthy patients  Percuss the Bladder #   Percuss downwards in the midline from the umbilical region towards the pubic symphysis A distended bladder will be dull to percussion  Assess Shifting Dullness #   Percuss from the umbilical region to patients left flank - if dullness noted - may suggest ascitic fluid Whilst keeping fingers over the area at which the note became dull, ask patient to roll onto their side Keep patient on their side for 30 seconds and then repeat percussion over the same area If ascites is present the area should now be resonant  Abdominal Auscultation #  Assess Bowl Sounds #  Auscultate¬†over¬†at least two¬†positions¬†on the abdomen to¬†assess bowel sounds:\n Normal bowel sounds:¬†typically described as gurgling (listen to an example in our video demonstration) Tinkling bowel sounds:¬†typically associated with bowel obstruction. Absent bowel sounds:¬†suggests ileus which is a disruption of the normal propulsive ability of the intestine due to a malfunction of peristalsis.  Listen for Bruits #  Auscultate¬†over the¬†aorta¬†and¬†renal arteries¬†to identify¬†vascular¬†bruits¬†suggestive of turbulent blood flow:\n Aortic bruits:¬†auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus, a bruit here may be associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Renal bruits:¬†auscultate 1-2 cm superior to the umbilicus and slightly lateral to the midline on each side. A bruit in this location may be associated with renal artery stenosis.  Legs #  Assess the patient‚Äôs¬†lower legs¬†for evidence of¬†pitting oedema¬†which may suggest¬†hypoalbuminemia¬†(e.g. [[liver cirrhosis]], protein-losing enteropathy).\nTo Complete the Exam #   Explain¬†to the patient that the examination is now¬†finished. Thank the patient¬†for their time. Dispose of PPE¬†appropriately and¬†wash your hands. Summarise¬†your findings.  Further Assessments and Investigations #   Check hernial orifices (e.g. if there are signs of bowel obstruction). If there is suspicion of gastrointestinal bleeding perform a PR exam. To rule out testicular torsion or indirect inguinal hernia a external genitalia exam may be needed  "},{"id":22,"href":"/Cardiovascular/Acute-Coronary-Syndrome/","title":"Acute Coronary Syndrome","section":"Cardiovasculars","content":"Acute Coronary Syndrome #  Acute coronary syndrome is¬†a term used to describe a range of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to the heart.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/Nephrology/Acute-Kidney-Injury/","title":"Acute Kidney Injury","section":"Nephrologies","content":"Acute Kidney Injury #  Previously known as acute renal failure.

Ask the patient to turn their head slightly to the left Inspect for evidence of IJV running between the medial end of the clavicle and the ear lobe, under the medial aspect of the sternocleidomastoid Measure the JVP¬†by assessing the vertical distance between the¬†sternal angle¬†and the¬†top of the pulsation point of the IJV¬†(in healthy individuals, this should be¬†no greater than 3 cm).  Hepatojugular Reflux Test (not Performed in an OSCE) #  The hepatojugular reflux test involves the application of pressure to the liver whilst observing for a sustained rise in JVP.\n In healthy individuals, this rise should last¬†no longer than 1-2 cardiac cycles¬†(it should then fall). If the rise in JVP is¬†sustained¬†and¬†equal to or greater than 4cm¬†this is deemed a¬†positive result.  A¬†positive hepatojugular reflux result¬†suggests the¬†right ventricle is unable to accommodate an increased venous return, but it is¬†not diagnostic¬†of any specific condition.

Xanthelasma:¬†yellow, raised cholesterol-rich deposits around the eyes - hypercholesterolaemia. Kayser-Fleischer rings:¬†dark rings that encircle the iris associated with [[Wilson‚Äôs disease]]. The disease involves abnormal copper processing by the liver, resulting in accumulation and deposition in various tissues (including the heart where it can cause [[cardiomyopathy]]).  Mouth #   Central cyanosis:¬†bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia (e.g. a right to left cardiac shunt) Angular stomatitis:¬†a common inflammatory condition affecting the corners of the mouth. It has a wide range of causes including iron deficiency. High arched palate:¬†a¬†feature of [[Marfan\u0026rsquo;s syndrome]] which is associated with mitral/aortic valve prolapse and aortic dissection. Dental hygiene:¬†poor dental hygiene is a risk factor for infective [[infective endocarditis]]  Chest #  Inspect #   Scars suggestive of previous thoracic surgery Pectus excavatum:¬†a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest. Pectus carinatum:¬†protrusion of the sternum and ribs. Visible pulsations:¬†a forceful apex beat may be visible secondary to underlying ventricular hypertrophy.  Palpation #  Apex Beat #   Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum  Heaves #  A¬†parasternal heave¬†is a precordial impulse that can be palpated.\n Place the¬†heel of your hand¬†parallel to the¬†left sternal edge¬†(fingers vertical) to palpate for heaves. If heaves are present you should feel the heel of your hand being¬†lifted¬†with each systole. Parasternal heaves are typically associated with¬†right ventricular hypertrophy.  Thrill #  A¬†thrill¬†is a¬†palpable vibration¬†caused by¬†turbulent blood flow¬†through a heart valve (a thrill is a palpable murmur). You should assess for a thrill across¬†each of the heart valves¬†in turn\n Auscultation #   Palpate the carotid pulse to determine the first heart sound.

For example, here is a List[Dictionary] example format, which is equivalent to the default:\nfavicon:- {rel:\u0026#34;shortcut icon\u0026#34;, href:\u0026#34;icon.png\u0026#34;, type:\u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34;}# - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to addIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it may be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the Apple touch icon to Amethyst\u0026rsquo;s default favicon:\nfavicon:|\u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;shortcut icon\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;icon.png\u0026#34; type=\u0026#34;image/png\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;apple-touch-icon\u0026#34; sizes=\u0026#34;180x180\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;/apple-touch-icon.png\u0026#34;\u0026gt;This second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your webpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more information about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read this article.\nNote that all generated favicon paths, defined by the href attribute, are relative to the static/ directory.\nGraph View #  To customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around data/graphConfig.yaml. The default configuration, with descriptions, can be found here.\nLanguage Support #   Chinese, Japanese, and Korean support comes out of the box with Amethyst.\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Amethyst) supports this natively.\nFollow the steps Hugo provides here and modify your config.yaml\nFor example:\n1 2 3 4 5 6  defaultContentLanguage:arlanguages:ar:languagedirection:rtltitle:ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿäweight:2  Custom Styles #  Want to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling in assets/_custom.scss. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in /layouts/partials.\nChanging the Color Scheme #  The default color schemes for light mode and dark mode are located in assets/_colors.scss. You can replace the values for existing color variables for drop-in edits, or create new variables to reference in _custom.scss.\nChanging the Fonts #  All fonts are defined in assets/_fonts.scss. There are examples for both local fonts (defined using @font-face) and webfonts (fetched with @import from a font distributor such as Google Fonts).\nYou can place all local fonts in the static/fonts folder.\nPartials #  Partials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in /layouts.\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through /layouts/index.html. To customize the footer, you can edit /layouts/partials/footer.html\nMore info about partials on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s website.\nStill having problems?

Thyroid hormones, primarily thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), play a crucial role in regulating the body\u0026rsquo;s metabolism. When the thyroid gland becomes overactive and releases an excessive amount of these hormones into the bloodstream, it leads to a state of hyperthyroidism. There are various underlying causes of hyperthyroidism, with the most common being [[Grave\u0026rsquo;s disease]].\nCauses/Factors #   [[Grave\u0026rsquo;s disease]]: An autoimmune disorder where the body\u0026rsquo;s immune system mistakenly attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to produce excess thyroid hormones. Most common cause of hyperthyroidism Toxic Multinodular Goiter: The thyroid gland develops multiple nodules that produce thyroid hormones independently, leading to an overproduction of hormones. Toxic Adenoma: A single nodule in the thyroid gland becomes overactive and produces an excessive amount of thyroid hormones. Subacute Thyroiditis: Inflammation of the thyroid gland causes the release of stored thyroid hormones into the bloodstream. Excessive Iodine Intake: Consuming a high amount of iodine, either through diet or medication, can lead to hyperthyroidism. Medications: Certain medications containing iodine or thyroid hormones can induce hyperthyroidism as a side effect.  Symptoms #   Weight Loss: Unexplained weight loss despite increased appetite. Nervousness and Irritability: Feeling anxious, jittery, or easily agitated. Heat Intolerance: Feeling excessively hot in normal temperatures. Increased Sweating: Perspiring more than usual, especially in the hands and feet. Tremors: Fine trembling of the hands and fingers. Palpitations: Rapid or irregular heartbeat. Fatigue: Feeling tired and weak even without physical exertion. Muscle Weakness: Experiencing muscle weakness, especially in the upper arms and thighs. Frequent Bowel Movements: Having more frequent and sometimes loose bowel movements. Changes in Menstrual Patterns: Irregular menstrual periods in women.  Signs #   Enlarged Thyroid Gland (Goiter): The thyroid gland may be visibly larger than normal, causing swelling in the front of the neck.  Smooth = Grave\u0026rsquo;s disease Nodular = toxic nodules Tender = thyroid inflammation   Tachycardia: Abnormally fast heart rate. Exophthalmos: In Grave\u0026rsquo;s disease, patients may have protruding or bulging eyes due to immune system attack on the eye tissues.  Diagnostic Tests #   Thyroid Function Tests: Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Radioactive Iodine Uptake (RAIU): Measures how much iodine the thyroid gland absorbs to determine its activity. Thyroid Scintigraphy: Imaging test using radioactive iodine to identify nodules or areas of increased thyroid activity. Thyroid Ultrasound: Imaging test using sound waves to visualize the size and structure of the thyroid gland. Antibody Tests: To detect antibodies associated with Grave\u0026rsquo;s disease.  Management #   Antithyroid Medications: Drugs like Methimazole and Propylthiouracil (PTU) can lower thyroid hormone production. Beta-Blockers: Used to manage symptoms like rapid heartbeat and tremors. Radioactive Iodine Therapy: Destroys part of the thyroid gland to reduce hormone production. Surgery (Thyroidectomy): Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland in certain cases. Iodine Restriction: Limiting iodine intake to reduce hormone production in the thyroid gland.  Complications/Red Flags #   Thyroid Storm: A life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden, severe worsening of hyperthyroid symptoms, which requires immediate medical attention. Osteoporosis: Long-term hyperthyroidism can lead to bone loss and an increased risk of fractures. Heart Problems: Untreated hyperthyroidism can strain the heart, leading to heart rhythm abnormalities and potential heart failure. [[Pregnancy]] Complications: Hyperthyroidism during pregnancy requires careful management to prevent harm to both the mother and the baby.

Eyes #   Conjunctival pallor:¬†suggestive of underlying anaemia*.*¬†Ask the patient to gently pull down their lower eyelid to allow you to inspect the conjunctiva. Ptosis, miosis and enophthalmos:¬†all features of [[Horner‚Äôs syndrome]] (anhydrosis is another important sign associated with the syndrome). Horner‚Äôs syndrome occurs when the sympathetic trunk is damaged by pathology such as lung cancer affecting the apex of the lung (e.g. Pancoast tumour).  Mouth #   Central cyanosis:¬†bluish discolouration of the lips and/or the tongue associated with hypoxaemia. Oral candidiasis:¬†a fungal infection commonly associated with steroid inhaler use (due to local immunosuppression). It is characterised by pseudomembranous white slough which can be easily wiped away to reveal underlying erythematous mucosa.  Chest #  Inspection #   Scars - check both axillae too Chest wall deformities  Asymmetry Pectus excavatum - caved-in or sunken appearance Pectus carinatum - protrusion of the sternum and ribs hyperexpansion (barrel chest) associated with [[asthma]] and [[COPD]]    Apex Beat #   Typically located in 5th intercostal space in midclavicular line Displacement of apex beat from its usual location can occur due to anything that shifts mediastinum  Assess Chest Expansion #  Can be assessed either anteriorly or posteriorly\n Place hands around patients chest inferior to the nipples Warp fingers around other side Bring thumbs together so they touch Ask patient to breath in Movement of thumbs should move symmetrically upwards \u0026amp; outwards   Percussion of Chest #   Resonant:¬†a normal finding Dullness:¬†suggests increased tissue density (e.g. cardiac dullness, consolidation, tumour, lobar collapse). Stony dullness:¬†typically caused by an underlying [[pleural effusion]] Hyper-resonance:¬†the opposite of dullness, suggestive of decreased tissue density (e.g. [[pneumothorax]]).  Auscultate Lung Fields #  Ask the patient to relax and breathe deeply in and out through their mouth\n Apices should be auscultated through the bell Auscultate symmetrically Normal vesicular breathing: ![[normal breathing.mp3]]  Quality of Breath Sounds #   Vesicular:¬†the normal quality of breath sounds in healthy individuals. Bronchial:¬†harsh-sounding (similar to auscultating over the trachea), inspiration and expiration are equal and there is a pause between. This type of breath sound is associated with consolidation.  Added Sounds #   Wheeze:¬†often associated with [[asthma]], [[COPD]] and [[bronchiectasis]] - lower airways ![[wheeze.mp3]] Stridor:¬†a high-pitched extra-thoracic breath sound¬†resulting from¬†turbulent airflow through narrowed upper airways. Stridor has a wide range of causes, including foreign body inhalation (acute) and subglottic stenosis (chronic). ![[inspiratory stridor.mp3]] Coarse crackles:¬†associated with [[pneumonia]], [[bronchiectasis]] and pulmonary oedema. ![[coarse crackles.mp3]] Fine end-inspiratory crackles:¬†associated with [[pulmonary fibrosis]] ![[fine crackles.mp3]]  Vocal Resonance #   Ask the patient to say \u0026ldquo;99\u0026rdquo; each time stethoscope is placed down in the same tone Auscultate all major regions comparing each side  Increased volume¬†over an area suggests increased tissue density (e.g. consolidation, tumour, lobar collapse).\nDecreased volume¬†over an area suggests the presence of fluid or air outside of the lung (e.g. pleural effusion, pneumothorax).\nRepeat All of above for Posterior Chest #  Except apex beat and chest expansion if already done\nFinal Steps #   Assess for sacral and pedal oedema Assess calves for signs of [[Deep Vein Thrombosis]] Inspect for evidence of [[erythema nodosum]], which can be associated with [[sarcoidosis]]  To Complete the Exam #   Explain¬†to the patient that the examination is now¬†finished.
